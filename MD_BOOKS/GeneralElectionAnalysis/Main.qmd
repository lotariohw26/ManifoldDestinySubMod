<h1 id="introduction-nevada-state-law-and-data-sources">Introduction:
Nevada State Law and Data Sources</h1>
<h2 id="nevada-state-law-ballots-are-not-counted-in-precincts">Nevada
State Law; Ballots are Not Counted In Precincts</h2>
<p>Before we can even begin to discuss illicit intervention and
manipulation of the vote totals, the reader must first understand that
ballots are not counted within precincts (voting stations). In fact, no
paper ballot filled out the by voter is ever counted at the Central
Counting Place, only the electronic entity upon the mechanical storage
device (which defines the ballot in the State Law) is ever counted.</p>
<p>The paper ballot filled out by the voter starts its life in the hands
of the voter and dies at the tabulator. The paper ballot filled out by
the voter is never once read or inspected by any human being, not even
in a recount or audit.</p>
<p>Quite often, academics that I have consulted with, agreed that the
mathematical facts concerning the Nevada election were indeed
suspicious, but they could not believe that the election itself could
have been tampered with.</p>
<p>When I ask them why (and I usually know what they are going to say),
their response is that they cannot envision a mass conspiracy of young
teenagers and old grandmothers working the polls or at the voting
centers altering the ballot counts to conform to county-wide
mathematical manifold.</p>
<p>It is in this moment that I must finally educate them that ballots
are no longer counted in precincts. For instance, in Maricopa, all
ballots, both Election Day, Early and Mail-in, are counted in one room
on nine machines. The following link displays the batch logs of these
nine machines courtesy of Maricopa: <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VoQ8_RIioVh9uYv0y7-w5gDU-F5MC0mS/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=100231490512233358920&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true"
class="uri">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VoQ8_RIioVh9uYv0y7-w5gDU-F5MC0mS/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=100231490512233358920&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true</a></p>
<p>Thus it is imperative to dispel the false image of stoic volunteers
at the precincts counting the ballots, because it is precisely this
false image that is conjured within imaginations of both the general
public and those in academia.</p>
<p>If this false image is not immediately addressed then neither the
general public nor academia can conceive of the election being
manipulated, as it would indeed be impossible for state wide conspiracy
of volunteers to alter the votes in each precinct according to a
county-wide formula.</p>
<p>In fact, dispelling this image is so important that it must appear as
the first point of discussion in this article, otherwise nothing else is
worth discussing.</p>
<p>In general, most States (especially the “Battleground States") now
use Centralized Counting, codified by their State Legislature. Even in
some States, such as Illinois, where the Election Day Vote is highly
supervised, counted by party observers at the precinct (making it
virtually impossible to rig the election day vote across the county),
the Mail-in Vote in Illinois is counted at a central location, after
which the mail-in ballots totals for each precinct are appended in the
report to the precinct that they belong to.</p>
<p>We will discuss Illinois in the later chapters, however, let us
return to subject of Nevada. We shall start with <strong>NRS 293, Title
34 - Elections</strong>. Here is link to election law:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-293.html"
class="uri">https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-293.html</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-293b.html"
class="uri">https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-293b.html</a></p>
<p>Here is the legal definition of the Central Counting Place:</p>
<p><strong>NRS 293.0335</strong> <em>“Central counting place” means the
location designated by the county or city clerk for the compilation of
election returns.</em></p>
<p>Here we see that a mail-in ballot is sent to every registered
voter:</p>
<p><strong>NRS 293.269911</strong> <em>Except as otherwise provided in
this section, the county clerk shall prepare and distribute to each
active registered voter in the county and each person who registers to
vote or updates his or her voter registration information not later than
the 14 days before the election a mail ballot for every
election.</em></p>
<p>This next statement comes with the Nevada Secretary of State’s
Office, who is authorized by law to codify the general procedures. Here
is the link to Nevada’s Election s Procedure Manual, as prescribed by
the Secretary of State: <a
href="https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/elections/election-resources/elections-procedures-manual"
class="uri">https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/elections/election-resources/elections-procedures-manual</a></p>
<p><strong>6.3 Ballot Drop Box</strong> <em>A ballot drop box is a
receptacle where voters can return mail ballots in sealed and signed
envelopes. The drop boxes may be supervised or <span
style="color: red">unsupervised</span> with security features, such as
cameras.</em></p>
<p>Here is Nevada State Law’s statement concerning the treatment of
mail-in ballots: <strong>NRS 293.269921; Procedure for timely returning
mail ballot; treatment of mail ballot when postmark cannot be
determined; requirements for ballot drop boxes.</strong></p>
<p><em>1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 and chapter 293D
of NRS, in order for a mail ballot to be counted for any election, the
mail ballot must be:</em><br />
<em>(A) Before the time set for closing of the polls, delivered by hand
to the county clerk, <span style="color: red">or any ballot drop box
established in the county</span> pursuant to this section;</em></p>
<p>Here is Nevada’s State Law concerning how others can return mail-in
ballots that do not belong to them: <strong>NRS 293.269923; Persons
authorized to return mail ballot</strong></p>
<p><em>(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, at the request
of a voter whose mail ballot has been prepared by or on behalf of the
voter, <span style="color: red">a person authorized by the voter</span>
may return the mail ballot on behalf of the voter by mail or personal
delivery to the county clerk, <span style="color: red">or any ballot
drop box</span> established in the county, pursuant to NRS
293.269921</em></p>
<p>So here we have a system, which by law, sends a mail-in ballot to
<strong>every registered voter</strong>, that can be returned by someone
<strong>other than the voter</strong>, to any
<strong>unsupervised</strong> drop box location, all of which are
brought to a Central Counting Place and “calculated" with computers.</p>
<p>In fact, the only way in which a registered voter does not receive a
mail-in ballot is if they go the Secretary of State’s website and
manually opt out of the process. Here is a link to the form that allows
Nevadan’s to opt out: <a
href="https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/home/showpublisheddocument?id=9833"
class="uri">https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/home/showpublisheddocument?id=9833</a></p>
<p>This is also stated, explicitly, in the Secretary of State’s Election
Procedure Manual: <strong>6.2.3 Mail Ballot Opt-Out</strong><br />
<em>The passage of Assembly Bill 321 during the 2021 Legislative Session
mandates <span style="color: red">all registered voters will
automatically receive a ballot by mail.</span> The Bill provides for
voters to opt-out of automatically receive a ballot by mail by
submitting the Mail Ballot Preference Form, also known as a “opt-out”
form. The form must be submitted at least 60 days before the next
election. The form is also used to identify that you wish to
automatically receive a mail ballot after previously opting-out of
automatically receiving a ballot by mail.</em></p>
<p>Now we shall read the Nevada State Law which says that the Election
Boards at the voting stations (precincts and early voting centers) do
not participate (and cannot by law) in the counting of ballots, they
only <strong>package them electronically</strong> for delivery to the
Central Counting Place, their only function being to maintain order (at
each voting station one member of the election board is deputized by the
sheriff) amongst the voters present at the voting station.</p>
<p><strong>NRS 293.307; Duties of voting board before
adjournment</strong><br />
<em>After the last person entitled to vote has voted, the voting board,
before adjourning, shall put the records and the account of ballots in
order <span style="color: red">for the counting board.</span></em></p>
<p>In fact, even if there’s a state emergency that prevents ballots from
being delivered to and processed at the Central Counting Place, the
Election Boards still cannot intervene and count the ballots (can’t have
that!), rather they have contingency plans to ensure that the Election
Boards <strong>can never be allowed to count the ballots!</strong></p>
<p>Let us read this contingency plan from the Nevada Secretary of
State’s Election Procedure Manual in section 4.7 <strong>4.7 Contingency
Plan</strong><br />
<em>As required by 2022 regulation,25 each county clerk shall, not later
than 60 days before the date of the general election, submit to the
Secretary of State a written contingency plan for: (1) election
operations in the event that election operations are significantly
disrupted; and (2) the tabulation of ballots in the event that the
county or city, as applicable, <span style="color: red">experiences a
loss of central counting equipment or the use of the central counting
place...</span></em><br />
<em>In addition, to the written contingency plan required, each county
clerk shall submit to the Secretary of State a written contingency plan
for the tabulation of ballots in the event that the county experiences
<span style="color: red">a loss of the central counting equipment or the
use of the central counting place...</span></em> <em>(a) Must, without
limitation, <span style="color: red">identify alternative counting
equipment and facilities</span>; and<br />
(b) May provide for the transport of ballots across county lines for the
purpose of ballot tabulation if the ballots are inventoried and can be
safeguarded <span style="color: red">by election staff and election
board officers in the same manner as the ballots would be protected if
the ballots were not transported.</span></em></p>
<p>You may be wondering if the above applies only to a state emergency,
and perhaps the “Election Boards" at the precinct would ordinarily
participate in counting process. I shall again cite State Law which
explicitly denies them such participation in the ordinary case:</p>
<p><strong>NRS 293B.330 Duties of election board upon and after closing
of polls; public may observe handling of ballots.</strong><br />
<em>1. Upon closing of the polls, the election board shall:<br />
(a) Secure all mechanical recording devices against further
voting.<br />
(b) If a mechanical voting system is used whereby votes are directly
recorded electronically:<br />
(1)Ensure that each mechanical recording device:<br />
(I)Provides a record printed on paper of the total number of votes
recorded on the device for each candidate and for or against each
measure; and<br />
(II) Transfers the ballots voted on that device to the storage device
required pursuant to NRS 293B.084.<br />
(2)Count the number of ballots voted at the polling place.<br />
(3) Account for all ballots on the statement of ballots.<br />
(4) Place all records printed on paper <strong>provided by the
mechanical recording devices</strong>, all storage devices which store
the ballots voted on the mechanical recording devices, and any other
records, reports and materials as directed by the county clerk into the
container provided by the county clerk to transport those items to a
central counting place and seal the container. (c) Record the number of
voters on a form provided by the county clerk.</em></p>
<p>As you can see, the election boards of the numerous voting stations
are not allowed to participate in the counting process, even during an
emergency. Their only function is to deliver the <strong>electronic form
of the ballots to the Central Counting Place</strong>. One wonders why
they are even called the “Election Board," since they do not participate
in the counting of ballots, it would be better to name them the
“Deputized Delivery Board" that only “counts" the number of ballots and
voters, not the candidate selections on those ballots.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they only provide a record of tabulations for the
candidate by the machine itself, not by their own count. In fact, no
human being (either the local election board or the centralized counting
board) ever physically examines the actual ballot filled out by the
voter.</p>
<p>The word “ballot" is in fact defined for us in the State Law, and it
is not only the paper ballot of the voter, it is also the electronic
entity stored on the mechanical recording device.</p>
<h2 id="legal-definition-of-a-ballot-in-nevada">Legal Definition of a
Ballot in Nevada</h2>
<p>It is again imperative that both the general public and those in
academia do not have a <strong>false idea</strong> of what a ballot it
is, for is it not only the physical paper ballot that was filled out by
the voter, but also a purely electronic entity that recorded what the
voter placed upon their paper form, and it is this electronic entity
that is “recounted" and “audited."</p>
<p>It is this electronic entity that is “counted" and “handled" at every
point in the election, and during any recount and/or audit. The physical
paper ballot given to a voter to place their votes is never read or
inspected by the election board. Only the electronic storage tape is
examined by Central Counting.</p>
<p>The physical paper ballot starts its life in the hands of the voter
and dies upon reaching the tabulator. It is never used again, even in a
recount or audit. The only remaining part of the physical paper ballot
filled out by the voter that is that can be examined by a human being
(by law) is the “stub."</p>
<p><strong>NRS 293.391; Disposition and inspection of ballots, lists,
records and <strong>stubs</strong> of voted ballots after canvass by
county commissioners.</strong></p>
<p><em>1. The voted ballots, rejected ballots, spoiled ballots,
challenge lists, records printed on paper of voted ballots collected
pursuant to NRS 293B.400, reports prepared pursuant to NRS 293.269937
<strong>and stubs of the ballots used</strong>, enclosed and sealed,
must, after canvass of the votes by the board of county commissioners,
be deposited in the vaults of the county clerk. <strong>The records of
voted ballots that are maintained in <span style="color: red">electronic
form</span></strong> must, after canvass of the votes by the board of
county commissioners, be sealed and deposited in the vaults of the
county clerk.</em></p>
<p><em>(4)A contestant of an election may inspect all of the material
regarding that election which is preserved pursuant to subsection 1 or
2, <strong><span style="color: red">except the voted ballots and records
printed on paper of voted ballots collected pursuant to NRS 293B.400
which are deposited with the county clerk.</span></strong></em></p>
<p><em>(5) The voted ballots and records printed on paper of voted
ballots collected pursuant to NRS 293B.400 which are deposited with the
county clerk are not subject to the inspection of anyone, except in
cases of a contested election, <span style="color: red">and then only by
the judge</span>, body or board before whom the election is being
contested, or by the parties to the contest, jointly, pursuant to an
order of such judge, body or board.</em></p>
<p>Again, not even a contestant of an election (or representative of a
contestant) can visually examine the physical paper ballot filled out by
the voter, unless given express permission by the judge.</p>
<p>The body/board will never give such permission, which you can witness
for yourself in this video recording of the Washoe Registrar of Voters
doing a recount :</p>
<p><a

class="uri">https://rumble.com/v1b4sf7-washoe-county-hides-vote-counting-of-election-and-recount-from-observers-vi.html</a></p>
<p>Here is how Nevada State Law defines “Ballot":<br />
<strong>NRS 293.025 “Ballot” defined.</strong> <em>“Ballot” means the
record of a voter’s preference of candidates and questions voted upon at
an election. The term includes, without limitation, any paper given to a
voter upon which the voter places his or her vote <span
style="color: red">and any electronic storage tapes.</span></em></p>
<p>Here again is where Nevada State Law codifies the electronic record
as the ballot:<br />
<strong>NRS 293B.330; Duties of election board upon and after closing of
polls</strong><br />
<em>1. Upon closing of the polls, the election board shall:<br />
(a) Secure all mechanical recording devices against further
voting.<br />
(b) If a mechanical voting system is used whereby votes are directly
recorded electronically...</em><br />
<em><span style="color: red">Transfers the ballots voted on that
device</span> to the storage device required pursuant to NRS
293B.084...all storage devices which store the ballots voted on the
mechanical recording devices...to transport those items to a central
counting place and seal the container.</em></p>
<p><strong>NRS 293B.084; Required features and design of mechanical
recording device which directly records votes electronically;
availability and use of paper record for manual audit.</strong> <em>1. A
mechanical recording device which directly records votes electronically
must:<br />
(a) Bear a number which identifies that mechanical recording
device.<br />
(b) Be equipped with a storage device which:<br />
(1) <span style="color: red">Stores the ballots voted on the mechanical
recording device</span>;<br />
(2) Can be removed from the mechanical recording device for the purpose
of <span style="color: red">transporting the ballots stored
therein</span> to a central counting place.</em></p>
<p>The final line highlighted in red makes it very clear that they have
de facto declared the electronic entity within the recording device as a
“ballot". Hence, when you see the term “ballot" throughout the Nevada
State Law and in the Secretary of State’s Election Procedure Manual,
they are always referring to this electronic entity, unless they
specifically state that they are talking about the physical paper ballot
filled out by the voter.</p>
<p>Hence, the Nevada State Law has also <strong>legalized deceptive
talking points to the public</strong>, because Nevadan election
officials can say, with a straight face to the public, that they
“recounted all of the ballots by hand," without telling you that all
they did was exactly what the law permits them to do in a recount: Take
the electronic voting tape, by hand, and feed it through the same
counting machine.</p>
<p>So now when I quote the Secretary of State’s Election Procedure
Manual, concerning the counting of Mail-in Ballots, you have already
been enlightened that they are talking about the digital entity inside
of a recording device, not the physical paper ballot submitted through
the US Postal Service.</p>
<p><strong>6.2.1.5; Mail Ballot Central Counting
Procedures</strong><br />
<em>A local election official shall appoint a Mail Ballot Central
Counting Board...The mail ballot central counting board is under the
direction of the local election official...The mail ballot central
counting board may begin counting the received mail ballots 15 days
before the day of the election. The board must complete the count of
<strong>all mail ballots</strong> on or before the seventh day following
the election.</em></p>
<p>I put the phrase “all mail ballots" in bold so that you can see that
the situation is identical to Maricopa in the neighboring state. All
mail-in ballots are counted in one room over the course of Nevada’s
<span style="color: red">Election Month.</span> Let us continue with
<strong>6.2.1.5</strong>.</p>
<p><em>The voting results of the mail ballot vote in each precinct must
be certified and submitted to the local election official, who shall
have the mail ballot results <strong>added to the votes of the precinct
that were not cast by mail ballot.</strong> The returns of the mail
ballot vote must be reported separately from the other votes that were
not cast by mail ballot in the precinct unless reporting the returns
separately would violate the secrecy of a voter’s ballot.</em></p>
<p>And there in bold you see the legal design that allows the county
recorder/registrar of voters, to report mail-in totals to the precincts,
as if they were counted in the precinct, even though they are not. They
are simply appended to the precinct report by fiat. In fact, Washoe
County didn’t even have its vote totals by counting group for each
precinct on files for months after the 2020 election, they had (as
you’ll see in a later figure in this section) to contact Dominion
directly to ascertain their own election results (MONTHS AFTER THE
ACTUAL ELECTION!).</p>
<p>In the next section of the Election Procedures Manual, it is again
affirmed that no human being ever counts the candidate choices or
proposition choices of a voter, they only “count" the number of ballots
(and that total number of ballots is all that the algorithm rigging the
election requires, for it invents its own numbers for the actual
candidate choices):</p>
<p><strong>6.5.3; Early Voting and Election Day Voting
Procedures-Election Board Officers</strong><br />
<em>After the close of voting on each day during the period for early
voting, the election officer in charge of a polling place for early
voting must determine the total number of persons who applied to vote
that day, voted in person at the polling place that day, and the ballots
cast at the polling place that day. If a difference exists between the
numbers, the difference must be reported in writing to the county clerk,
together with any known reason for the difference. The numbers must be
entered and reported by the election board on the forms provided by the
county clerk.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-legal-futility-of-public-observation">The Legal Futility of
Public Observation</h2>
<p>The next quoted sections shows your the futility of “Public
Observation." Note that this is for the precincts, not the counting
location.<br />
<strong>6.9 Observers</strong><br />
<em>NAC provides for “meaningful observation.” Meaningful observation
means a person may observe the process of identifying the voter, the
distribution of a ballot or voting machine card, the movement of a voter
to a voting booth, the return of a ballot voting machine card, and the
existing of a polling place by a voter. The term does not allow the
viewing of the personal information of a voters, a voter’s ballot <span
style="color: red">or selections on a voting machine</span>, or the
ability <strong>to listen to any conversation between election board
officers</strong> or between a voter and election board
officer...However, observers inside a polling location must abide by
certain laws and regulations...MUST remain in their designated area;
MUST stay away from the ICX Primes; MUST NOT use electronic
communication devices. Instruct observers to turn off any cell phones,
laptops, two-way radios, etc; MUST NOT photograph or record inside the
polling place. Instruct observers to leave any cameras, audio recorders,
video cameras, etc., with the Manager (NRS 293.274).; MUST NOT argue for
or against or challenge any decisions of county or city election
personnel; MAY be removed from the polling place by the county or city
clerk for violating any of the provisions above.</em></p>
<p>Public Observation becomes even more futile at the Central Counting
Location, as the County Clerk can simply deny any one other than select
friends to view the process by placing an arbitrary limit of their own
choice upon the number of allowed observers, and remove anyone of their
choice that exceeds their arbitrary number of observers.</p>
<p><strong>6.9.2; Observing the Counting of Ballots</strong><br />
<em>Members of the general public may observe the counting of the
ballots at the central counting place if those members do not interfere
with the counting of ballots. The central counting place is the location
designated by the county or city clerk for the compilation of election
returns...<br />
Requiring that before a person may observe the processing and counting
of ballots, the person must <strong>sign an acknowledgement</strong>
that certain behavior is prohibited at the central counting place.<br />
Notice that the county or city clerk may limit the number of persons
observing in the central counting place.<br />
Notice that the county or city clerk may remove a person from the
central counting place.<br />
Is prohibited from Using a mobile telephone or computer within the
central counting place<br />
</em></p>
<h2 id="votes-are-computed-by-law-not-counted">Votes are Computed By
Law, Not Counted</h2>
<p>This segment of Nevada Law speaks for itself. The ballots are not
counted—they are “computed."</p>
<p><strong>NRS 293B.360; Creation of special election boards;
appointment of members to boards.</strong><br />
<em>To facilitate the <span style="color: red"><strong>processing and
computation of votes cast</strong></span> at any election conducted
under a mechanical voting system, the county clerk shall create a
computer program and processing accuracy board.</em></p>
<h2
id="recounts-only-rerun-the-electronic-tape-from-the-election-through-the-same-machine">Recounts
only rerun the electronic tape from the election through the same
machine</h2>
<p><strong>NRS 293B.400; Paper record required in event of recount or
contest of election; duty of clerk to collect and deposit paper
records</strong><br />
<em>Except as otherwise provided in this section, if a recount is
demanded pursuant to the provisions of NRS 293.403 or if an election is
contested pursuant to NRS 293.407, the county or city clerk shall ensure
that each mechanical recording device which directly recorded votes
electronically for the applicable election provides a <span
style="color: red">record printed on paper of each ballot voted on that
device.</span><br />
2.In carrying out the requirements of this section, the county or city
clerk shall:<br />
(a)Print <strong>only</strong> the records required for the recount or
contest; and<br />
(b) Collect those records and deposit them in the vaults of the county
or city clerk pursuant to NRS 293.391 or 293C.390.</em></p>
<p>As you can see, at no point is the physical paper ballot, filled out
by the voter, ever used in a “recount." Nevada State Law makes it
impossible for a recount to return anything other than the originally
reported count, because all they do is rerun the electronic tape (which
is defined as a ballot!) through the same machine.</p>
<h2 id="additional-law-and-code-relevant-to-this-article">Additional Law
and Code Relevant to this Article</h2>
<p>The final segments of Election Law and Secretary State Election Code
relevant to this article are as follows. I assume that the reader has
already read the five prior subsections of this introductory chapter, so
I will provide no more narrative, since any additional narrative will
only be a repeat of those things already narrated.</p>
<p><strong>NRS 293B.033; “Mechanical voting system”
defined.</strong><br />
<em>“Mechanical voting system” means a system of voting whereby a voter
may cast a vote:<br />
1.On a device which mechanically or electronically compiles a total of
the number of votes cast for each candidate and for or against each
measure voted on; or<br />
2.By marking a paper ballot which is <span
style="color: red">subsequently counted on an electronic tabulator,
counting device or computer.</span></em></p>
<p><strong>NRS 293B.345; Election Board relieved of responsibility after
delivery and receipt"</strong><br />
<em>The election board has no further responsibility for the care,
custody, security, <span style="color: red">tabulation</span> or
counting of ballots after the official ballots have been delivered to a
receiving center or to the central counting place and a receipt has been
issued for such ballots.</em></p>
<p>And here’s the punchline of the remaining legal material:</p>
<p><strong>NRS 293.352; Unlawful to mark and sign mailing ballot on
behalf of voter or assist voter to mark and sign mailing ballot;
exceptions; <span style="color: red">Repealed</span></strong>. Yes, you
read that right, this provision was repealed, it says so in the
title.</p>
<h2

one knows where the physical paper ballots are located in Washoe County;
Exhibit of County Commissioner Jeanne Herman’s Legal Affidavit</h2>
<p>Even though Nevada State Law demands chain of custody and retention
of the “voted ballots" (the paper ballot filled out the voter) for 22
months after an election...sadly, no one knows where they are in Washoe
County.</p>

<p>The 2022 CVR must be used to reconstruct the precinct level data by
counting group for the 2022 Primaries.</p>
<p>Here is a link to the CVR (cast vote record) compiled tabulations for
Gilbert, Lombardo and Sisolak: <a

<p>Since the Precinct Level Results By Counting Group are not readily
available for the 2020 Election, they had to be obtained directly in
private communication with the Washoe County Recorder (who didn’t even
have them, they first had to petition Dominion months after the
election). On page four is proof of the communication that resulted in
the release of the Precinct Level Counting Group results. For the 2022
General Election, the CVR, which is has not yet been made available on
their website, was sequestered via direct communication with the
Registrar of Voters. Here is the link to the CVR in Excel:<a

<p>This is the spreadsheet of the combined county tabulations that we
shall be using for the remainder of this article: Nevada 2020, Clark and
Washoe Tabulations:<br />

<p>The second tab in the above spreadsheet contains 1075 of the 1286
precincts. These are the precincts that meet the arbitrary criterion of
having no less than 50 ballots cast in each counting group.</p>
<p>If any precinct in any of the four counting groups (Trump Early,
Biden Early, Trump Mail and Biden Mail) reported less than 50 ballots
cast, then that precinct was excluded from the official analysis in
order to ensure that the decimal resolution of the division of any two
counting groups is at least <span class="math inline">1%</span>, and
that the decimal resolution of any counting group divided by the total
number of ballots cast in all four groups is at least <span
class="math inline">0.5%.</span></p>
<p>Of these 1075 precincts, an additional three precincts were removed
for outstanding outlying behavior, reducing the final count of analyzed
precincts from 1075 to 1072.</p>
<p>It is the inability to either locate official tabulation sources (by
counting group) or to access them in a usable form (such as
spreadsheet), that acts as the greatest barrier to detailed election
analysis.</p>
<p>One would think that the public would have immediate access to the
tabulation results of their own county, including a breakdown of
Election Day, Mail-in and Early Voting per precinct.</p>
<p>Nay, this is actually not the case—thus it is very frustrating to
procure such data across the United States, and often impossible. And
when such data sources can be procured, one must then put that data in a
usable form (most sources provided by the County are in PDF form, such
that each relevant entry must be placed manually by hand into a
spreadsheet!)</p>

<p>Before we proceed to the main body of this article, I decided to
query ChatGPT for its opinion of the following question before writing
and submitting this article for publication, below is the link to this
conversation: <a
href="https://chat.openai.com/share/f72a566c-cdb0-47f0-ab3f-3146f7e3c109"
class="uri">https://chat.openai.com/share/f72a566c-cdb0-47f0-ab3f-3146f7e3c109</a></p>
<p>“Let A be Alice’s Early Vote, B be Bob’s Early Vote, C be Alice’s
Mail-in Vote and D be Bob’s Mail-in Vote at a particular precinct. Also,
let N be the sum of A,B, C and D, which is the sum of all ballots cast
at the precinct.</p>
<p>Would it be unusual for a dataset of over 1000 precincts, from two
different geographic regions (one urban and one suburban) on different
sides of the same State (such as Clark and Washoe Counties in Nevada),
for there to be a strong linear regression from N and A onto D (that is,
with the <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> of the
regression exceeding 0.98), allowing someone to predict D knowing only N
and A?”</p>
<p>The response:</p>
<p>“If there is a dataset of over 1000 precincts from two different
geographic regions (one urban and one suburban) on different sides of
the same State (such as Clark and Washoe Counties in Nevada), and there
is a strong linear regression with an <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> exceeding 0.98 between
the variables N (the sum of A, B, C, and D) and A (Alice’s Early Vote)
onto D (Bob’s Mail-in Vote), it would be unusual and raise concerns
about the authenticity and integrity of the data.</p>
<p>A high <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> value
suggests a strong relationship between the predictor variables (N and A)
and the response variable (D). In this case, it would indicate that
knowing the sum of all ballots cast (N) and Alice’s Early Vote (A) would
allow for accurate predictions of Bob’s Mail-in Vote (D). Such a strong
relationship could imply a pattern or correlation <strong>that is not
expected in a fair and unbiased voting process.</strong></p>
<p>In a democratic election, the votes cast by different individuals
should be independent and not significantly influenced by external
factors <strong>such as the total number of votes or the votes cast by
other individuals</strong>. Therefore, if there is a strong linear
regression allowing precise predictions of Bob’s Mail-in Vote based on N
and A, <strong>it could raise concerns about potential anomalies,
manipulation, or non-authentic behavior within the dataset.</strong></p>
<p>In such cases, <strong>further investigation and analysis would be
<span style="color: red">necessary</span></strong> to understand the
underlying reasons for this relationship and determine whether any
irregularities or biases have affected the voting process."</p>
<p>Although I personally believe that such evidence is sufficient to
convince a Jury in a Court of Law to rule the 2020 and 2022 Nevada
election a fraud, nevertheless further investigation is indeed necessary
before a definitive conclusion can be reached.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a spreadsheet of tabulations does not provide us with
the means to investigate the issue any further, nor is the source code
of voting software publicly available; thus, only the authorities
themselves can carry out a further investigation of these facts and how
they occurred.</p>
<p>I do however concur with the response given by ChatGPT that indeed
such a further investigation is <span
style="color: red">necessary</span> to ascertain how this result could
occur in a purported “safe and secure election."</p>
<p>For this reason, I authorize the journal to accept additional
co-authors with either concurrent or dissenting opinions.</p>
<p>However, in order to ensure that the conversation remains balanced, I
only authorize one dissenting opinion per one concurrent opinion
(including my own); thus if no other concurrent opinions are added to
this article, then only one dissenting opinion is permitted.</p>
<p>It is entirely up to the intellectual capacity and critical reading
skills of the reader to discern those things which are absolute
mathematical fact and those that are opinion.</p>
<p>That is, anything that I say that cannot be strictly written in a
mathematical form, is indeed opinion; however, I am certain that these
“opinions" would be “made facts" in a Court of Law if brought before a
Jury. Woe to the “expert" that has to defend a constant ratio of ballot
counts across the precincts of two distant counties.</p>
<h1
id="the-twenty-laws-and-forty-isometries-that-govern-the-proportion-between-four-disjoint-sets">The
Twenty Laws and Forty Isometries That Govern the Proportion Between Four
Disjoint Sets</h1>
<p>In most elections across the United States, there are only two major
candidates, one of the Democrat Party and one of the Republican Party.
By Law, no voter may vote more than once, nor may vote for more than one
candidate (excluding races which permit multiple candidate
selection).</p>
<p>As such, at any particular voting station (precinct), the set of
ballots cast for each nominee are mathematically disjoint; furthermore,
that the set of ballots for each counting group and each nominee (such
as Republican Early, Republican Mail-in, Democrat Early and Democrat
Mail-in) as also mathematically disjoint.</p>
<p>Because they are disjoint, the ratios between any four non-empty
disjoint subsets from any number of disjoint counting groups for the
same race (that is, we cannot mix the ballots from different races at
the same precinct) are beholden to the sixty mathematical tautologies
found in <strong>Definition 1.2</strong>.</p>
<p>The following definitions assume a rigid referential system, this
system being the four quadrants of square. I shall describe in plain
English the real life scenario which gives birth to the figure on page
21.</p>
<p>Suppose that there is an election occurring inside of a High School
gym.</p>
<p>The Trump Early Ballots are placed in the Northwest corner, the Biden
Early Ballots are placed in the Northeast Corner. Thus, all early
ballots reside solely within the Northern Half of the gymnasium.</p>
<p>In order to retain a clockwise relationship between the vote ratios,
we now place Trump’s Mail-in ballots in the Southeast Corner (diagonally
across from Trump’s Early ballots in the Northwest); likewise, we place
Biden’s Mail-in Ballots in the Southwest Corner (which are diagonally
across from Biden’s Early ballots in the Northeast). Thus, all of the
Mail-in ballots reside solely within the Southern Half of the Gym.</p>
<p>Having the counting groups placed in these four quadrants allows to
rapidly switch between the relationships of any pairing of quadrants via
isometric formulation; while maintaining the rigidity of referential
system (in other words, Trump’s Early ballots will always physically
remain in the Northwest Corner, regardless of how we are analyzing the
quadrants and their relationships; the same is also true for the other
ballot types).</p>
<p>The first quadrant pairings that we analyze are the Northern Quadrant
Pair vs the Southern Quadrant Pair, which is the Early Vote vs the
Mail-in Vote. This is the natural way that one would approach an
election, hence the North vs South paradigm is the called the “Standard
Orientation." The second quadrant pairings that we would naturally
analyze are the Diagonal pairings, which would be Republican Early Vote
and the Republican Mail-in Vote, vs, the Democrat Early Vote and
Democrat Mail-in Vote. In this orientation we comparing Republican
voters against themselves (the ratio of Republicans that preferred to
vote early as opposed to by mail); likewise we are also comparing
Democrats against themselves (the ratio of early vs mail-in preference),
and when the two diagonals are contrasted against each other, we are
contrasting the preference of both parties to vote Early or by Mail.</p>
<p>Thus the Diagonal vs Diagonal Paradigm is called the Preference
Orientation, as it allows us to contrast the preferred type of ballot
casting both within the same party and between parties.</p>
<p>Before I discuss the third orientation (West vs East), let’s start
with the first and second orientations. In the figure on page nine you
shall see the Standard Orientation of Early vs Mail-in (North vs South).
Within this gym (precinct), let <span
class="math inline"><em>s</em>, <em>t</em>, <em>u</em>, <em>v</em></span>
be Trump’s Early, Biden’s Early, Trump’s Mail-in Vote and Biden’s
Mail-in Vote (respectively).</p>
<p>Trump’s Early Percentage is denoted as <span
class="math inline">$x=\frac{s}{s+t}$</span>; Trump’s Mail-in Percentage
is denoted as <span class="math inline">$y=\frac{u}{u+v}$</span>.</p>
<p>The last natural parameter in this orientation is the Proportion of
Mail-in to Election Day Ballots, zeta, where <span
class="math inline">$\zeta=\frac{u+t}{s+t}$</span>. In a fair election,
some people choose to cast their ballots Early, and other prefer to cast
them via mail.</p>
<p>Amongst those two groups, some will choose to vote Republican and
others will choose to vote Democrat; hence, although there may be (and
is expected to be) strong correlations between Trump’s Early Percentage,
Trump’s Mail-in Percentage and the Proportion of Mail-in to Election Day
Votes across a set of precincts, they generally operate independent of
each other.</p>
<p>Whereas Trump’s total percentage of <strong>all ballots cast</strong>
at the precinct <strong>cannot be known until all ballots are
cast!</strong> The Early Vote is one event, and the Mail-in Vote is
another event, and the proportion of those that participated in either
event is the timeless relationship between the Early Vote and Mail-in
Vote. The combined action of these events yields Trump’s Total
Percentage, thus the Early Vote and the Mail-in Vote are the
<strong>Cause</strong> and Trump’s Total Percentage is the
<strong>Effect</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus, when we have deterministic formulas that allow us to deduce
Trump’s Mail-in Percentage from Trump’s Total Percentage and his Early
Percentage, without needing to know the Proportion of Mail-in to
Election Day Votes, then something is clearly wrong with the
<strong>Arrow of Time</strong>. How could Trump’s Total Percentage be
the <strong>Cause</strong> of his Mail-in Percentage? Likewise, how
could Biden’s Mail-in Vote be the <strong>effect</strong> of the Total
Ballots Cast and Trump’s Early Vote (like in Clark and Washoe Counties
in 2020)?</p>
<p>Under no circumstance does it make sense that we can predict Biden’s
Early Vote knowing only the Total Ballots Cast and Trump’s Early Vote,
with no knowledge of Trump’s Mail-in Vote or Biden’s Early Vote, for
such a relationship implies that the Early and Mail-in Votes have
forfeit their general independence, and somehow a future event (the
total ballots cast) became the <strong>cause</strong> of Biden’s Mail-in
Vote, instead of Biden’s Mail-in Vote being one of the four independent
events that <strong>caused</strong> the total ballots cast.</p>
<p>Now you may say “correlation is not causation," but let’s get real
here, we’re talking about an election with four time-dependent events.
We can predict Biden’s Mail-in Vote with an <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.985</span> with a
simple plane equation of the Total Ballots Cast and Trump’s Early Vote;
likewise we can invert this plane equation in order to yield Total
Ballots Cast from Trump’s Early Vote and Biden’s Mail Vote, or Trump’s
Early vote from Total Ballots Cast and Biden’s Mail-in Vote...all of
which are absurd, since the relationship disavows the natural time
dependency of the events in question, whilst also completely
disregarding Trump’s Mail-in Vote and Biden’s Early Vote.</p>
<p>Nay, this is not just a high correlation, but indeed causation: The
<strong>Cause</strong> being a Rigged Election.</p>
<p>Let us now return our attention to the diagram on page nine: Trump’s
Percentage of all ballots (which shall heretofore call Trump’s Aggregate
Percentage) is denoted <span
class="math inline">$\alpha=\frac{s+u}{(s+u)+(t+v)}$</span>.</p>
<p>There is second aggregate percentage: The percentage of all ballots
cast that are Election Day Ballots, we shall call this Omega, which as a
direct identity with zeta, viz. <span
class="math inline">$\Omega=\frac{s+t}{(s+t)+(u+v)};
\Omega=\frac{1}{\zeta+1}; \zeta=\frac{1-\Omega}{\Omega}$</span>.
Although both entities (Omega and zeta), contain the same information,
their usage and geometric meaning manifest different.</p>
<p>For instance, the aggregate percentage is written as a weighted sum
of <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>, which invokes Omega in its
simplest form: <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em> = <em>x</em><em>Ω</em> + (1−<em>Ω</em>)<em>y</em></span>.
However we could also write: <span
class="math inline">$\alpha=\frac{x+\zeta y}{\zeta+1}$</span>, but this
form has no geometric meaning, especially since the denominator is
equivalent to Omega, ie. <span class="math inline">$\alpha=\frac{x+\zeta
y}{\zeta+1}=\frac{1}{\zeta+1}(x+\zeta y)$</span>.</p>
<p>However, if we attempt to solve for <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, it is the other way around. Now
we must invoke zeta in order for the description of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> to have meaning: <span
class="math display"><em>x</em> = <em>α</em> + <em>ζ</em>(<em>α</em>−<em>y</em>)</span>
This equation states that <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is
the reflection of <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> over the
value of <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> by a length equal
to the distance from the reflector (<span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>) to image (<span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>) scaled by <span
class="math inline"><em>z</em><em>e</em><em>t</em><em>a</em></span>.
Using Omega to describe <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, we
yield: <span
class="math inline">$x=\frac{\alpha-(1-\Omega)y}{\Omega}$</span></p>
<p>There is simply no way to rationalize the above equation in plain
English, because it not how Mother Nature herself would represent <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>. Hence, even though Omega and zeta
contain the same information, there is a proper time and place for
invocation of either—but never both simultaneously. More specifically,
where <span class="math inline">$\cos(\theta)=\sqrt{\Omega}$</span> and
<span class="math inline">$\sin(\theta)=\sqrt{1-\Omega}$</span> and
<span class="math inline">$\tan(\theta)=\sqrt{\zeta}$</span>: <span
class="math display">$$\alpha=x\cos^2(\theta)+y\sin^2(\theta)=\frac{x+y\tan^2(\theta)}{1+\tan^2(\theta)}=\frac{x+y\tan^2(\theta)}{sec^2(\theta)}$$</span>
<span
class="math display">$$\alpha=\frac{x+y\tan^2(\theta)}{1+\tan^2(\theta)}
\implies
x=\alpha+\alpha\tan^2(\theta)-y\tan^2(\theta)=\alpha+\tan^2(\theta)(\alpha-y)$$</span></p>
<p>Finally, there is a third aggregate percentage. This percentage is
called Lambda, and represents the percentage of ballots cast that are on
the West Side of square. Thus <span
class="math inline">$\lambda=\frac{s+v}{(s+v)+(u+t)}$</span>.</p>
<p>In a fair election we would never consider an entity such as <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>, because no one would think to
examine the relationship of Trump’s Early Vote and Biden’s Mail-in Vote
vs Trump’s Mail-in Vote and Biden’s Early Vote, because <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> does not describe a particular
behavior or preference of the electorate. Lambda is also known as the
“Obstacle Percentage."</p>
<p>I shall elaborate more upon why this is the “Obstacle Percentage in
Section 1.13 of this Chapter, titled “The Geometric Absurdity of
Constant Lambda."</p>
<p>However, to summarize the issue for the time being, that if <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> has constant value across the
precincts (a consistent mean with a small standard deviation, like in
Nevada), such as <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em> = 65%</span>
across the precincts (the real average is 63.5%, but I’m keeping it
multiples of 5% for easy reading), it means that Trump needs to get 65%
of the Election Day Vote before he can get more the 35% of the Mail-in
Vote, because Biden’s Mail-in Percentage, is the reflection of Trump’s
Election Day Percentage, over the reflector, <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>, scaled by <span
class="math inline">$\zeta^{1}=\frac{\Omega}{1-\Omega}$</span>.</p>
<p>Thus if Lambda is sitting at 65% across the precincts, then Biden’s
Mail-in Percentage cannot fall below 65% (meaning Trump’s Mail-in
Percentage cannot exceed 35%) until Trump acquires at least 65% of the
Election Day Vote—hence constant lambda is an <strong>tremendous
obstacle</strong> to Republicans if <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em> &gt; 55%</span> across the precincts and
an obstacle to Democrats if <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em> &lt; 45%</span> across the precincts.</p>

<p>In the next figure we see the Diagonal vs Diagonal Orientation. For
elections we call this the Preference Orientation, assuming that either
diagonal contains ballots for the same candidate.</p>
<p>The Republican Preference Percentage is the ratio of Republican Early
ballots to all Republican ballots cast, that is which percentage of
Republicans preferred to vote Early at the precinct, and is given by
<span class="math inline">$m_{1}=\frac{s}{s+u}$</span>. whereas its
complement is the percentage of Republicans that preferred to vote by
mail.</p>
<p>When the diagonals are constrained to the same candidate, then we
call it the “Northwest Preference Percentage" or the “Republican
Preference Percentage", otherwise we default to the name “Northwest
Ratio". Likewise, the other diagonal represents the “Democrat Preference
Percentage," or more generally the “Northeast Ratio", given by <span
class="math inline">$n_{1}=\frac{t}{t+v}$</span>.</p>
<p>Since there is no way to visually divide the two sets of diagonal
quadrants (while having both sets physically touching), a magenta
hyperbola was used to represent the ratio of <span
class="math inline"><em>ξ</em></span>, where <span
class="math inline"><em>ξ</em></span> is the ratio of all Democrat
ballots to all Republican ballots, just as zeta is the ratio of all
Northern Ballots to Southern ballots in the Standard Orientation.</p>

<p>If we were to put Trump’s and Biden’s Early ballots in the same box,
we label the box “Early." Likewise if we then put the remaining ballots
(Trump’s and Biden’s Mail-in ballots) in another box, we would label the
box “Mail-in." Both of these boxes would be the physical incarnation of
the Standard Orientation (North vs South).</p>
<p>If we were to put Trump’s Early and Mail-in ballots in the same box,
we would label this box “Republican" or “Trump." Likewise if we then put
the remaining ballots (Biden’s Early and Mail-in ballots) in another
box, we would label the box “Democrat" or “Biden." This would be the
Preference Orientation (Diagonal vs Diagonal).</p>
<p>However, if were to put Trump’s Early ballots and Biden’s Mail-in
ballots in the same box—how would we label the box? We can’t, because
there’s no word in the English language that could describe this ballot
mixture.</p>
<p>Thus it is no wonder that the culprits behind this crime used this
type of ballot mixture, because no one would even think to analyze such
a thing.</p>
<p>In fact, I only discovered the relationship by
<strong>accidentally</strong> swapping the columns of Biden’s Early and
Mail-in votes in the spreadsheet I was using to analyze the Nevada
elections.</p>
<p>Yes, be it an act of my own clumsiness or an Act of G-d, it was only
due to a lucky mistake in the spreadsheet column placement for Biden’s
Early and Mail-in ballots that I discovered the West vs East
paradigm.</p>
<p>Once I was enlightened to mathematical existence of the ratios
between these strange ballot mixtures, I immediately plotted the <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>α</em></span>
coordinates of all the precincts of other counties in other States (such
as Atlanta, GA; Chicago, IL) and not only did coordinates form a
parametric surface, but eccentrically curved surfaces (unlike the flat
plane formed by the <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>α</em></span>
coordinates of Clark and Washoe Counties). If you go Georgia you get a
quartic saddle, in Michigan you get a quadratic corkscrew, in Nevada a
flat plane, in Maricopa a four dimensional cubic rollercoaster that uses
the number of registered voters in its denominator (instead of ballots
cast in the denominators), in Texas you get complex number vector
manifolds that rig two elections at the same time! In fact, we even get
a quaternionic vector manifold that rigged four statewide elections in
Clark and Washoe Counties in the following cycle (2022 General
Election).</p>
<p>Not only are the voters of these regions very creative in their
manifold shapes and types, but they even took their artistry to
unprecedented levels by invoking the quaternions. I am so glad that our
elections are “safe and secure," and that the common man has decided to
collectively express their will through four-component vectors. Imagine
how pleased Hamilton would be to know that his work is finally being
appreciated and enjoyed throughout our nation! Let us now return our
attention to the next figure on page 16. There is simply no label that
we can assign to the West vs East paradigm, as such, we shall call it
the “Bastard Orientation."</p>
<p>In this orientation we are comparing Trump’s Early Ballots and
Biden’s Mail-in ballots vs Trump’s Mail-in Ballots and Biden’s Early
Ballots.</p>
<p>The percentage of ballots belonging to Trump on the west side is
simply called “Trump’s West Side Ratio," which is given by <span
class="math inline">$g=\frac{s}{s+v}$</span>.</p>
<p>The percentage of ballots belonging to Trump on the east side is
simply called “Trump’s East Side Ratio," which is given by <span
class="math inline">$h=\frac{u}{u+t}$</span>.</p>
<p>However, here comes the curious thing about this orientation (and
it’s this very thing that makes rigging elections in the West vs East
paradigm so easy): The Proper Aggregate of this orientation is the exact
same as the North vs South orientation; that is, <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em> = <em>x</em><em>Ω</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>Ω</em><sub>2</sub><em>y</em> = <em>g</em><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>λ</em><sub>2</sub><em>h</em></span>.</p>
<p>Thus whether we are in the Standard (North vs South) or Bastard (West
vs East) orientation, <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>
remains the same, and represents the same thing geometrically in both
Orientations, viz. Trump’s Percentage of all Ballots Cast.</p>
<p>In the Bastard Orientation <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> becomes intuitive. It represents
the percentage of all ballots that are on the West Side, and hence acts
as the weight of the West Side Ratio, which is why its called the West
Aggregate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the East Aggregate (which is <span
class="math inline">1 − <em>λ</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>λ</em><sub>2</sub></span>)
is the percentage of all ballots cast that are on the east side, acting
as the weight of the East Side Ratio; hence, <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em> = <em>g</em><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>λ</em><sub>2</sub><em>h</em></span>.</p>
<p>The one thing that all of the “Aggregate" percentages have in common
is their denominator (which are equal to the total number of ballots
cast); whereas the ratios between a quadrant pairing only have two
totals in the denominator. Outside of the Bastard Orientation, there is
no conceivable meaning to the West and East Aggregates. This is why the
lambda ratio is not considered or examined in a fair a election, because
its meaningless—people don’t cast their ballots in Bastard Form.</p>
<p>Adam: “Hey Bob, I’m voting for Trump after work at the Early Voting
Center."</p>
<p>Bob: “Damn...I was going to vote for Biden at the Early Voting
Center—but since you’re a Republican and you’re going to the Early
Voting Center—I’m going to send my Biden ballot via mail instead."</p>
<p>Although the above dialogue sounds ridiculous, this is exactly what
it would mean if people cast their ballots in Bastard Form. It requires
illicit communication of voter intent and illicit confirmation of
candidate selection for the voters of a precinct to cast their ballots
according to an equation written in the Bastard Form.</p>
<p>This is why ChatGPT said: <em>In a democratic election, the votes
cast by different individuals should be independent and not
significantly influenced by external factors <strong>such as the total
number of votes or the votes cast by other
individuals</strong>.</em></p>
<p>Therefore, if there is a strong linear regression allowing precise
predictions of Bob’s Mail-in Vote based on N (Total Ballots Cast) and A
(Alice’s Early Vote), <strong>it could raise concerns about potential
anomalies, manipulation, or non-authentic behavior within the
dataset.</strong></p>
<p>All of has been written in the previous few pages is exactly what
ChatGPT was able to immediately deduce...exactly what any common man,
with or <strong>without a math degree, would be able to
deduce.</strong></p>
<p>Thus, to any of those that are currently having dreams of writing a
“profound refutation of Edward Solomon’s claims" know that it is not me
that needs to be convinced, but the ordinary common man, who can utilize
a handheld calculator to add Trump’s Early Vote to Biden’s Mail-in Vote
and divide it by the total number of Early and Mail-in ballots cast, and
keep getting the same ratio of 63.5% with only a minuscule error.</p>
<p>If you do not believe you could deliver your “profound refutation" to
a jury of ordinary citizens with a straight face, then you ought not to
write it, for even you do not believe in it.</p>
<p>In Figure 5, below, we see the West vs East Orientation. The magenta
line now runs vertically instead of horizontally as did in the North vs
South Orientation, and it represents the proportion between the East and
West sided ballots.</p>
<p>The Early Percentage (the north ratio) of <span
class="math inline">$x=\frac{s}{s+t}$</span> has been replaced by the
West Ratio of <span class="math inline">$g=\frac{s}{s+v}$</span>.</p>
<p>The Mail-in Percentage (the south ratio) of <span
class="math inline">$y=\frac{u}{u+v}$</span> has been replaced by the
East Ratio <span class="math inline">$h=\frac{u}{u+t}$</span></p>
<p>Both ratios and their replacements retain the same term in their
numerator, only exchanging their summands in the denominator.</p>
<p>Hence why the West vs East paradigm is so attractive for those who
wish to do evil, as it retains its comparison of Candidate A vs
Candidate B, while (as already mentioned) not being something that an
honest person would ever consider analyzing.</p>
<p>Remember that I only discovered this paradigm by a miraculous
accident of misplaced columns in a spreadsheet...what if I had not made
“mistake?"</p>

<h2 id="the-importance-of-the-twenty-laws-and-forty-isometries">The
Importance of the Twenty Laws and Forty Isometries</h2>
<p>The Twenty Laws instruct us that is impossible for solve for any of
Cardinality Ratios without knowing three other distinct Cardinality
Ratios from the same orientation.</p>
<p>Let us examine the West vs East Isometry of the Ninth Law: <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em> = <em>g</em><em>λ</em> + <em>λ</em><sub>2</sub><em>h</em></span>.</p>
<p>It says that we require knowledge of <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>, <em>h</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> in order to solve for <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>, thus, if there exists a
relationship between between any three of the four ratios, <span
class="math inline">{<em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>α</em>, <em>λ</em></span>},
that allows us to solve for one of them knowing only the other two, with
no knowledge of the remaining fourth ratio, then it is an indicator that
something is wrong with the dataset (assuming its a dataset of
concerning four distinct human behaviors, which are supposed to exhibit
variability, instead of determinism).</p>
<p>In general, if any of the Twenty Laws (or their respective
isometries) are violated, viz. the dataset allows us to predict any one
of cardinality ratios with only one or two other cardinality ratios
(from the same orientation), instead of three, then we have due cause to
investigate the issue further.</p>
<p>The way in which I present the above paragraph to the general public
is via the diagram below, which I have named the “Fishtank Paradox."
Suppose you have two water tanks of equal width and height. One is
filled to 25% of its height, and the other to 75% of its height. You
then connect the two tanks with pipe and open the value, what will be
the resultant equilibrium height?</p>
<p>Often they will answer 50%, but then I show them that the question is
impossible to answer, unless you know the ratio of their lengths. In the
center image, the two tanks have the same length, so they do level out
to 50%; however, in the right image their lengths are in a One to Three
proportion, so they level out to 62.5%. Thus the diagram is a literal
depiction of the Ninth Law.</p>

Need for the Convergence, Constraint and Irrelevance Lemmas</h2>
<p>However there are trivial conditions under which finding a near
deterministic relationship in a such a dataset would not be indicative
of non-authentic human behavior.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose the average proportion of Mail-in to Early
Votes was 20:1, then the aggregate percentage of any precinct would
mostly be the same as the Mail-in Percentage, because the Early Vote is
essentially non-existent compared to the Mail-in Vote.</p>
<p>Thus if found a strong linear regression from <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>, being the Early and Mail-in
Percentages for a candidate at a precinct, onto <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>, being the candidate’s aggregate
percentage, it would not be surprising to see an <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> exceeding 0.99, since
<span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> is approximately equal to
<span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>.</p>
<p>However, this would also imply that our ability to predict the Early
Percentage, <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, would be
severely impaired, knowing only <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>p</em><em>h</em><em>a</em></span>
and <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>. Thus, if the proportion
of Mail-in to Early votes was 20:1, and we could predict Early
Percentage from the Mail-in Percentage and the Aggregate Percentage,
with no knowledge of exact value of <span
class="math inline"><em>ζ</em></span> (the proportion of Mail-in to
Early Votes) at a precinct, then again, there would be a severe problem
with the dataset.</p>
<p>Thus there exists a trade-off in predictive value concerning <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> at a precinct given knowledge of
<span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>. This trade off depends upon
the average value of <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> (or
<span class="math inline"><em>ζ</em></span>) across the dataset.</p>

<p>The below figure is a Precinct Library Card. The Zeroth Tensor Index
is the Precinct Number “w." The First Tensor Index is the Race Array.
There are 12 races in the below figure. The Second Tensor Index is the
Candidate Array, there are 6 candidate indices in the below figure. The
Third Tensor Index is the Mode Array, there are four modes in the below
figure.</p>
<p>Thus, regardless of the software being used, the Tensor Element <span

<p>You will see <span style="color: red">in cell H1</span> there is an
operator that requests the Race Number. When a valid race number is
entered it immediately produces <strong>F</strong>. Whichever software
and coding you use (such as MATLAB or Python), it must be capable of
producing <strong>F</strong> with no errors or ambiguities as seen in
the spreadsheet example.</p>
<p>When you visit the spreadsheet link, you can go to “File" and then
“Make a Copy" to learn and experiment with the optimal spreadsheet code
that I wrote to accomplish this in Excel.</p>
<p>The reason I personally do everything in Excel is because it can be
replicated by members of the general public (it does not require coding
knowledge specialized for a particular piece of software or platform).
It can also be examined, cell by cell, to ensure integrity in the

<p>This is called a “Real Number" STUV Array, because when we’re only
analyzing a single race, we use real numbers.</p>
<p>When we analyze two races simultaneously, we need Complex Numbers
(The Twenty Laws and Forty Isometries hold for Complex Numbers). When we
analyze Four Races at a time, we need the Quaternions (The Twenty Laws
and Forty Isometries hold for the Quaternions, assuming one minds left
and right handed multiplication and division).</p>

<p>The STUV assignments set as binary column vectors in cells B2 to E29.
If the value is 1, then that counting group is included within the
respective subset. We then multiply each <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> row
vector of the <strong>F</strong> Array by the S,T,U and V binary column
vectors to yield <span
class="math inline"><em>s</em><sub><em>b</em></sub>, <em>t</em><sub><em>b</em></sub>, <em>u</em><sub><em>b</em></sub></span>
and <span class="math inline"><em>v</em><sub><em>b</em></sub></span> in
each precinct. The arbitrary cull number of <span
class="math inline"><em>Ψ</em></span> should be set to 50 for low
turnout general elections, 100 for high turnout general elections and 30
for low turnout primary elections.</p>
<p>The cull number ensures a decimal resolution of <span
class="math inline">$\frac{1}{\Psi}$</span> for the denominators of
<span
class="math inline"><em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>m</em></span>
and <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> (that is, for the
quadrant pairing percentages of North vs South, West vs East and
Diagonal vs Diagonal); whilst ensuring a decimal resolution of <span
class="math inline">$\frac{1}{2\Psi}$</span> for the denominators of
<span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em>, <em>α</em>, <em>λ</em></span>.</p>
<p>A culling is performed to avoid false negatives for election fraud,
since an election with 10 votes cast will have a residual error of 10%
in its aggregate percentages, such that a sizeable collection of
precincts with low vote totals would adversely effect the <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> values of any manifold
regression of any three percentages (from the same Orientation, such as
North vs South), allowing a rigged election to escape detection.</p>
<p>Any additional precincts that are culled for other reasons (for
instance, in Nevada, the mean value of <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> was 0.635 with a small standard
deviation, but there were three precincts that were more than five
standard deviations above/below the mean that were removed from the
analyzed set), must be specified in writing.</p>
<p>If you do wish to cull any precincts from the Analyzed Set, then when
any regression of the data is performed over the precincts, the RSS and
TSS (Residual Sum of Squares and Total Sum of Squares) for each <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span>
precinct must be weighted by the formula <span
class="math inline">$\frac{s_{b}+t_{b}+u_{b}+v_{b}}{S+T+U+V}$</span>,
where the denominator is sum all of S,T,U,V ballot categories for all
precincts in the data set. <span style="color: red">No other form of
weighting may be used. This form of weighting only takes into account
the number of ballots cast at the precinct compared to that of the
entire dataset</span>.</p>
<p>The advantage of a cull number is that it does not introduce any bias
into the results, the precincts are simply culled by an arbitrary number
of ballots cast. This is why <strong>I personally prefer</strong> using
a Cull Number rather than weight based upon ballots cast.</p>
<p>Whereas using the above weighting function will alter the <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> in manner that
reflects the precincts with the largest vote totals (that is, the final
quartile of the precinct set carries the most weight)— yet once a
decimal resolution of 1% is reached in the denominator (a precinct with
100 total votes cast), the <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> of the regression
should no longer be adversely affected by the quantization of the
denominator.</p>
<p>Election reports from Caucus events, such as in Iowa, that have four
or more candidates can be analyzed, which is important in the age of
“Remote Satellite Caucuses," which is an overt effort to remove the
physical in-person and easily verified headcount of a traditional caucus
event inside of a high-school gymnasium (Bernie Sanders primaries and
caucuses in 2016 and 2020 are definitely interesting in the context of
this publication!).</p>
<p>The last definition illustrates why universal mail-in voting (with no
alternate option, like in Oregon), because we can no longer analyze and
contrast the behaviors of different subsets of the electorate for
suspicious activity, as we’ll usually be left with only two significant
candidates with one mode of unsupervised voting, yielding only two
distinct unsupervised counting groups.</p>
<p>This is also why Ranked-Choice Voting is so dangerous, because we can
no longer form disjoint subsets, as the reported numbers for each
candidate are derived from a conflated group of voters (thus, the
numbers reported are not disjoint).</p>
<p>Finally, this is why the heavy reduction of geographical precincts
(like in Illinois) is dangerous, because suspicious activity can be
smoothed out over a smaller group of precincts with large population
sizes, with no way to recover local trends.</p>
<p>Sadly, we have politicians that are actively trying to pursue
universal mail-in ranked-choice voting all tabulated at one central
location...do you see the problem?</p>
<p>They aren’t doing this for “convenience" or “accessibility" or
“fairness." They are doing it because the voting software companies are
instructing them to. The voting software companies do not want people
like you or me to analyze the results of their product.</p>

Function, The Percentage Array</span><br />
Given a set of analyzed precincts, <strong>Q</strong>, let the precincts
in <strong>Q</strong> be sorted from least to greatest alphanumerically
(this sorting should be automatic since <span
class="math inline"><em>W</em><sub><em>F</em></sub></span> is sorted
numerically, which is derived from <strong>W</strong>, which itself
preserves the alphanumeric ordering of all precincts in

precinct in the list (remember that <span
class="math inline"><em>β</em><sub>7</sub></span> is the total number of
precincts in <strong>Q</strong>) and let the first precinct in the list
be the <span style="color: red">FIRST</span> element of
<strong>Q</strong>. That is, we start with the Ordinal 1, instead of
zero, for the principal subset index.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, let <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> be known as
the <strong>Principal Subset Index</strong>.</em></p>

you see the Quantile Array.</p>

<p>In other words, the as one portion of the total vote becomes
irrelevant (for instance if the proportion of Election Day to Mail-in
ballots was absurdly low, then the election day percentage at a precinct
carries no effective weight on the aggregate and is pretty much
irrelevant), the ability to predict the percentage of ballots cast in
the irrelevant category becomes increasing difficult from the aggregate
percentage and the percentage of ballots in the other category (that is,
from the example in the prior set of parentheses, it would become nearly
impossible to predict a candidate’s election day percentage at a
precinct from the candidate’s aggregated and mail-in percentage when the
mean value of <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em><sub>1</sub></span>,
which is the percentage of ballots cast that are election day ballots,
is close to 0%).</p>

<p>To paraphrase the above corollaries, if one plots the early and
mail-in percentages of a candidate (<span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>2</sub></span>), and they mostly
(within 95% of the data points) fall between the lines <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>x</em><sub>1</sub> − 0.1</span>
and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>x</em><sub>1</sub> + 0.1</span>,
then the regression of <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em><sub>1</sub></span> from <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>1</sub></span> (or any inversion of
such a regression) will have a relatively high <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> value.</p>
<p>The same idea applies for the West Side and East Side Percentages. If
95% of the g,h coordinates fall between the lines <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>g</em><sub>1</sub> − 0.1</span>
and <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>g</em><sub>1</sub> + 0.1</span>,
then we again expected a rather high <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> value for the
regression of <span class="math inline"><em>α</em><sub>1</sub></span>
from <span class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub>1</sub></span>. To know what the
expected <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> value
is in a fair election under the same circumstances, one must perform a
minimum of 10,000 quantile simulations replicating the local trajectory
and residuals of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>y</em><sub>1</sub></span>
and <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em><sub>1</sub></span> over the
quantiles of <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span>,
and then another 10,000 simulations of the same trajectories and
residuals over the quantiles of <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>1</sub></span>, and then perform the
regression of <span class="math inline"><em>α</em><sub>1</sub></span> in
terms of <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span> and
<span class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>1</sub></span> and record the
<span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> value of each
simulation, then find the mean and standard deviation of the <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> expectation and
compare it against the actual election.</p>
<p>I have mentioned Quantile Simulations more than once—in Chapter 2 we
will cover how one perform a Quantile Simulation of an election over the
reals (single race), complex numbers (two races) and quaternions (four
races).</p>
<p>In the below figure you see the map of <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub>1</sub></span> for the 2020 General
Election of Clark and Washoe Counties for Trump and Biden. Although the
majority of the data points fall within the “Crest" (which is between
the two outer red diagonal lines), because the standard deviation of
<span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> is effectively zero, the 3D
scatter of <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>h</em><sub>1</sub></span>
and <span class="math inline"><em>α</em><sub>1</sub></span> over the

<p>Before we advance to the last two corollaries of the Twixt Lemma
(which are trivial isomorphisms to the previous corollary), let’s take a
look at what this means.</p>
<p>The below link will bring you to a Simple (Non-Quantile) Simulator,
which, given:</p>
<p>(1) A set mean and standard deviation of the election day percentage,
<span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span>, (2) A set mean
and standard deviation of the difference from <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span> to <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>1</sub></span> (average difference
between the election day and mail-in percentages across the precincts)
(3) A set mean and standard deviation for <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em><sub>1</sub></span> (average percentage of
ballots cast that are election day ballots)</p>
<p>Will then simulate 1000 precincts under the above three conditions,
using the NORM.INV(RAND(), Mean, Sigma) Excel Function.</p>
<p><a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aWA9YcxXHFFV8zrV60BV_QJm-nt8qbSx9L3Rijh1b8Q/edit?usp=sharing"
class="uri">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aWA9YcxXHFFV8zrV60BV_QJm-nt8qbSx9L3Rijh1b8Q/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>After the precincts are simulated, it calculates the forced value of
<span class="math inline"><em>α</em><sub>1</sub></span> via the Ninth
Law. It then calculates the regression of <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em>1</span> in terms of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>1</sub></span> and the <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> of the regression. The
simulation parameters for the mean and standard deviation of <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em><sub>1</sub></span> are set in cells B3
and B4 (respectively).</p>
<p>Three simulations were setup for the mean and standard deviation of
the election day and mail-in percentages in cells B7:B10 for the first
simulation, cells B14:B17 for the second simulation and cells B21:B24
for the third simulation.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> return
for each of the three simulations appear in cells B28:B30. Notice, that
although the mean and standard of <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em><sub>1</sub></span> is the same in all
precincts, the expected <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> values (after 100
trials) can be found in cells B32:B34 for each simulation, the standard
deviation of the expected values (after 100 trials) can be found in
cells B40:B42 and the Sigma Rating of the current simulation (the
difference from the expected <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> to the current <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span>, divided by the
standard deviation) can be found in cells B36:B38 for each of the three
simulations.</p>
<p>Notice that although all three simulations have the mean and standard
deviation for <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em><sub>1</sub></span>,
that they have different mean and standard deviations for their expected
<span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> values. This is
due to the <strong>Twixt Lemma</strong>. As the absolute value of the
mean difference between the election day and mail-in percentages (<span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>1</sub></span>) increases, the
expected <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span>
decreases rapidly, but the standard deviation decreases slowly.</p>
<p>Overall, any election matching the conditions of any of those three
simulated parameters, should produce an <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> within five standard
deviations of the mean expectation. That being said, we do not use such
simple parameters to run a simulation (the spreadsheet link was provided
as a preliminary example of a simulation for the context of this
subsection)—we use Quantile Simulations.</p>
<p>For now, observe (in Figure Ten below) that the <span
class="math inline">(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>,<em>y</em><sub>1</sub>,<em>α</em><sub>1</sub>)</span>
coordinates of all three simulations are bounded between the same two
planes (since they have the mean and standard deviation for <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em><sub>1</sub></span>), regardless of the
mean and standard deviation of the election day percentage and the mean
and standard deviation of the difference between the election day and
mail-in percentages.</p>
<p>Here is direct link to the 3D Scatter Plot:<br />
<a href="https://plotly.com/~EKSolomon/100/"
class="uri">https://plotly.com/~EKSolomon/100/</a></p>
<p>This is why one must always observe the mean and standard deviations
of <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>α</em><sub>1</sub></span>
and <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span>, and use
their own common sense (prior to even running a quantile simulation) if
the high <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> of
their manifold regression should be expected in a fair election under
the same conditions.</p>
<p>Hence, there exists a potential “Goldilocks Zone" for a
<strong>S,T,U,V</strong> a denomination (Will County, Illinois being the
ultimate example), where the mean values of <span
style="color: red">all</span> three aggregates bounded between 25% and
75%, and the mean difference (absolute) between the West and East
Percentages is in excess of 25%, yet an invertible and highly curved
cubic manifold forms for <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>h</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>α</em><sub>1</sub></span>
(unlike that flat plane of Clark County), with an <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> well in excess of
0.99!</p>
<p>More likely than not (if the election was rigged), you will find that
the manifold used to rig the election has an <strong>S,T,U,V</strong>
denomination in the “Goldilocks Zone," because such denominations are
those that the Neural Network will find the most productive towards the
manipulation the vote proportions.</p>

<p>Speaking of the “Goldilocks Zone," although we do not have time to
analyze Will County, Illinois in detail, I shall present the general
results of that election.</p>
<p>For the 2022 General Election, in the Clerk’s Race of Fritz vs Ferry,

<span class="math inline"><em>s</em><sub><em>b</em></sub></span> be

<span class="math inline"><em>t</em><sub><em>b</em></sub></span> be

<p>Let <span
class="math inline">$g_{b,1}=\frac{s_{b}}{s_{b}+v{b}}$</span> be Ferry’s
West Side Ratio in each precinct.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">$h_{b,1}=\frac{s_{b}}{u_{b}+t{b}}$</span>
be Ferry’s East Side Ratio in each precinct.<br />
Let <span
class="math inline">$\alpha_{b,1}=\frac{s_{b}+s_{b}}{s_{b}+t{b}+u_{b}+v{b}}$</span>

Let <span

be percentage of all Election Day Ballots Cast for each precinct.<br />
Let <span
class="math inline">$\lambda_{b,1}=\frac{s_{b}+tv{b}}{s_{b}+t{b}+u_{b}+v{b}}$</span>
be the West Side Vertical Aggregate for each precinct.<br />
The mean and standard deviation of <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em><sub><em>b</em>, 1</sub></span> across the
precincts is 66.72% and 08.06% respectively.<br />
The mean and standard deviation of <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em><sub><em>b</em>, 1</sub></span> across the
precincts is 45.60% and 14.05% respectively.<br />
The mean and standard deviation of <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub><em>b</em>, 1</sub></span> across the
precincts is 56.71% and 06.64% respectively.<br />
The mean and standard deviation of <span
class="math inline">|<em>g</em><sub>1, <em>b</em></sub> − <em>h</em><sub>1, <em>b</em></sub>|</span>
is equal to 33.01% and 14.61%.<br />
The mean and standard deviation of <span
class="math inline">|<em>g</em><sub>1, <em>b</em></sub> − <em>h</em><sub>2, <em>b</em></sub>|</span>
is equal to 21.18% and 17.60%.</p>
<p>Given the above information (which you can confirm from the County
Recorder’s precinct totals in the following url link), you wouldn’t
expect there to be a deterministic function that allows one to calculate
<span class="math inline"><em>α</em><sub><em>b</em>, 1</sub></span> from
<span class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub><em>b</em>, 1</sub></span> and
<span class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>b</em>, 1</sub></span>. The
means and standard deviations of <span
class="math inline"><em>l</em><em>a</em><em>m</em><em>b</em><em>d</em><em>a</em><sub>1, <em>b</em></sub></span>
and the differences between the West and East Side Ratios would imply a
large 3D cloud far away from the “Crest." Yet, with an <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.9932</span>, we can
calculate them with the following equation (the subscript “b,1" was
removed to save space): <span
class="math display"><em>α</em> = <em>c</em><sub>0, 0</sub> + (<em>c</em><sub>1, 0</sub><em>h</em>+<em>c</em><sub>1, 1</sub><em>g</em>) + (<em>c</em><sub>2, 0</sub><em>h</em><sup>2</sup>+<em>c</em><sub>2, 1</sub><em>g</em><em>h</em>+<em>c</em><sub>2, 2</sub><em>g</em><sup>2</sup>) + (<em>c</em><sub>3, 0</sub><em>h</em><sup>3</sup>+<em>c</em><sub>3, 1</sub><em>g</em><em>h</em><sup>2</sup>+<em>c</em><sub>3, 2</sub><em>g</em><sup>2</sup><em>h</em>+<em>c</em><sub>3, 3</sub><em>g</em><sup>3</sup>)</span>

cells B6:C14, the spreadsheet itself is an antiquated format before the
Array Definitions, which appear in this article, were formalized).</p>
<p>The <strong>S,T,U,V</strong> binary array is found in cells B30:E35.
The <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> of the cubic
regression of Fritz’s West, East and Aggregate Ratios is found in cell
C2 (with the regression itself being performed on the “Bivariate Cubic"
sheet). The <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> of
the regression of <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub><em>b</em>, 1</sub></span> from <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em><sub><em>b</em>, 1</sub></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>b</em>, 1</sub></span> is 0.9895
with no outlying precincts or culled precincts, and exceeds 0.99 with
minimal outlier removal.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> of the
regression of <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>b</em>, 1</sub></span> from <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em><sub><em>b</em>, 1</sub></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub><em>b</em>, 1</sub></span> is 0.9686
with no outlying precincts or culled precincts. And although this <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> is lower than the
others, it’s not because of a lack of manifold’s precision, but rather
that the manifold folds over itself (no longer a one-to-one function)
when <span class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub><em>b</em>, 1</sub></span>
is the output, which confuses the Least Squares Regression. You can
interact with Will County’s 3D Scatter plot in the below link, where the
green data points are the election’s g,h,alpha coordinates and the red
data points display the manifold’s general shape within the unit cube.

<p>In the next figure we the Atlanta (Georgia) 2020 Election of Trump vs
Biden. The definitions for <strong>S,T,U,V</strong> are the same as they
are for Clark and Washoe Counties Nevada, viz. <strong>S,T,U,V</strong>
are Trump’s Early Vote, Biden’s Early, Trump’s Mail-in Vote and Biden’s
Mail-in Vote across the precincts of the counties making up Atlanta. We
again yield a cubic manifold for <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>p</em><em>h</em><em>a</em><sub>1</sub></span>
in terms of <span class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub>1</sub></span> and
<span class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub>1</sub></span> for Atlanta
Georgia, just like in Will County Illinois. Yet—in the Clark and Washoe
Counties (Nevada), in 2020 and 2022, we get a perfectly flat plane using
the same definitions of <strong>S,T,U,V</strong>, and being a flat
plane, it makes <span
class="math inline"><em>l</em><em>a</em><em>m</em><em>b</em><em>d</em><em>a</em><sub>1</sub></span>
constant over the precincts of Clark and Washoe, allowing us to explain
the rig using only vote totals (that is, we can calculate Biden’s
Mail-in Vote knowing only the total number of ballots cast and Trump’s
Early Vote).</p>
<p>What makes this even stranger is that you only need a sample of size
of a few precincts to predict the remaining 1200 precincts. If these
facts are not sufficient to assert that the election was rigged (beyond
all reasonable doubt), then what kind of mathematical facts would be?
Remember, that if you’re planning on writing a “stunning refutation of
Edward Solomon’s claims" you’re going to have to explain why we find
curved manifolds in some battleground states and flat manifolds in other
battleground states, and why these manifolds only appear in the West vs
East Orientation (but not in the natural North vs South Orientations).
Here are the links to the 2020 Election for Trump vs Biden in Atlanta:

</div>
<p>The Invariance Aggregate Lemmas are a critical tool in the
Prosecution’s toolkit, since no meaningful Quantile Simulations can be
performed when either <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em>, <em>Ω</em></span> or <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> are invariant across the
precincts, because whether or not the data analyst performs a simulation
from the North vs South, East vs West or Diagonal vs Diagonal
perspectives, the invariance of any aggregate will have imprinted itself
upon all three of those perspectives.</p>
<p>Thus, all simulations will be that of an unchanging parameter.</p>
<p>No matter how many times one simulates the elections of Clark County
in Nevada, they will always get an <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span>&gt;0.99 for the
manifold of regression of either <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>, <em>h</em></span> or <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> from the remaining two, because
<span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> will always be invariant
(63.5%) in the simulations, compelling, in every precinct:</p>
<p><span
class="math inline"><em>α</em><sub>1, <em>b</em></sub> = 0.65<em>g</em><sub>1, <em>b</em></sub> + 0.35<em>h</em><sub>1, <em>b</em></sub></span>
and <span
class="math inline">$g=\frac{\alpha_{1,b}-0.35h_{1,b}}{0.65}$</span> and
<span
class="math inline">$h=\frac{\alpha_{1,b}-0.65g_{1,b}}{0.35}$</span></p>
<p>In this situation the <strong><span style="color: red">Burden of the
Prosecution</span></strong> is not to show that the <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> of the election result
is above or below the Five-Sigma Rule via Quantile Simulations (which is
how one must prove that Maricopa 2020 and 2022 were rigged), but rather
to convince the <strong>Jury</strong> that the Invariance of Lambda
across 1200 precincts, in two counties, on opposite sides of the State
of Nevada, is absurd by definition; while it is the <strong><span
style="color: red">Burden of the Defense</span></strong> to convince the
<strong>Jury</strong> that is perfectly normal for the proportion of two
disjoint ballot sets to be uniform across 1200 precincts in two distant
counties on opposite sides of the State of Nevada (I would much prefer
to be the prosecution in this case!).</p>
<p>In other words, if I told the Jury, "What are chances of Trump’s
Early Vote and Biden’s Mail-in Vote being 63.5% of all ballots cast at
each of the 1286 precincts, in two highly populated and demographically
different counties on opposite sides of the State of Nevada? No one
knows for sure the exact chance of this event, but we all know
intuitively that whatever that chance may be, it is effectively zero,
and never happen in real life. How could millions of voters across two
counties make such a uniform decision to split their ballots equally
between the mathematically abstract East and West Sides of the
precinct?"</p>
<p>How do you think the Jury would rule?</p>
<p>Do you think you could say anything to the Jury that would make them
rule otherwise? If not, I suggest you don’t write a “stunning refutation
of Edward Solomon’s claims."</p>
<h2 id="the-hyperbolic-reflection-theorem">The Hyperbolic Reflection
Theorem</h2>
<p>Before we move on to the following chapters, there is one piece of
pure mathematical theory that we must cover. This final theorem is what
allows us to restore an election to its original state prior to the
tabulations being manipulated by Lambda Invariant Manifold.</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p><strong>Theorem 5</strong>. <em><span>Hyperbolic Reflection
Theorem</span><br />
The Sixth Law states that: <span
class="math display"><em>y</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>λ</em><sub>2</sub> − <em>ζ</em><sup>−1</sup>(<em>λ</em><sub>1</sub>−<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>)</span>
Which can rewritten as: <span
class="math display"><em>y</em><sub>2</sub> = <em>λ</em><sub>1</sub> − <em>ζ</em><sup>−1</sup>(<em>λ</em><sub>1</sub>−<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>)</span></em></p>
<p><em>Which, in the case of Clark County, says that Biden’s Mail-in
Percentage, <span class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>2</sub></span> is
the vertical reflection of Trump’s Early Percentage, <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span>, over the line (value)
of <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span>, scaled
inversely proportional to <span class="math inline"><em>ζ</em></span>,
which is the Proportion of Mail-in to Early Votes.</em></p>
<p><em>Hence if <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span>
is constant over the precincts (regardless of their sorting) and the
trajectory of <span class="math inline"><em>ζ</em></span> declines over
the quantiles of <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span>
(when the precincts are sorted by Trump’s Early Percentage), then it
follows that the Sixth Law will induce a dynamic rotation matrix upon
the trajectory of <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>2</sub></span> (Biden’s Mail-in
Vote), since Trump’s Early Percentage will be reflected over an
invariant flat horizontal line (the value of <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> in each precinct), at a
hyperbolically increasing scale, to produce Biden’s Mail-in Percentage,
causing the natural linear relationship between Trump’s Early Percentage
and Biden’s Mail-in Percentage to deform into a hyperbolic relationship
(that can be well approximated by quartic).</em></p>
</div>
<h2 id="the-two-common-sense-assumptions">The Two Common Sense
Assumptions</h2>
<p>Suppose you asked a fifth grader: “If I was so hated at specific
place, that I got 0% of the election day vote, what percentage of the
mail-in vote do you think I would get."</p>
<p>The Fifth Grader would answer correctly: "About 0%."</p>
<p>Suppose you asked a fifth grader: “If I was so loved at specific
place, that I got 100% of the election day vote, what percentage of the
mail-in vote do you think I would get."</p>
<p>The Fifth Grader would answer correctly: “About 100%."</p>
<p>Suppose you asked a fifth grader: “If I was there was a tie at
specific place, such that I got 50% of the election day vote, what
percentage of the mail-in vote do you think I would get."</p>
<p>The Fifth Grader would answer (incorrectly): “About 50%." However,
the Fifth Grader’s answer is only incorrect in an election where we
expect Democrats to prefer to vote by mail, otherwise he’d be right
on.</p>
<p>You now draw the coordinates of his three answers, (0,0), (50,50) and
(100,100). You tell him to connect the three dots. He will draw a
straight line, at 45 degrees from the origin through those three
points.</p>
<p>You now ask the Fifth Grader: “What do you think that line means?"
The Fifth Grader would answer incorrectly: “That your mail-in percentage
will be roughly equal to your election day percentage in each
precinct."</p>
<p>A Tenth Grader would produce the same answer in a little more detail:
“That although it would be unusual for your election day percentage and
mail-in percentage to be the EXACT same in every precinct, it would also
be unusual for them to not be strongly correlated along that 45 degree
line."</p>
<p>An undergraduate would say (incorrectly): “That in general, party
affiliation, such as Democrat or Republican, shouldn’t have a
significant effect on a candidate’s performance on election day and in
the mail." The undergraduate would then go on to take a linear
regression of the mail-in percentage in terms of the election day
percentage (like Professor Grimmer did in the Gilbert vs Lombardo case)
and be surprised to see that the slope wasn’t anywhere near 45 degrees.
This is because the linear regression of y from x is not the same as the
eigenvector of x+iy.</p>
<p>The graduate student would say (correctly): “That the eigenvector of
the election day and mail-in coordinates would be close to forty-five
degrees in a fair election, such that, even if one particular political
party had an advantage in one form of voting, that advantage would be
relatively constant over the dataset, such that general relationship, or
eigenvector, would be at or close to 45 degrees, excluding the corners
of the unit square, where x approaches 0 and 1, where y must also
converge on 0 and 1 respectively."</p>
<p>The Mainstream Media and Election Abusers would say: “But Democrats
vote overwhelming by mail, so you’re all wrong—and pay no heed to the
man behind the curtain drawing up those manifolds! And pay no attention
that Republicans also vote overwhelming by mail for the establishment
candidates (such as Lombardo) in their primaries! Pay no heed to the
fact the Democrats vote more by mail in Republican Precincts than they
in Democrat precincts!"</p>

both the <span class="math inline">(<em>x</em>,<em>α</em>)</span> and

should also be at 45 degrees, even if there is a mean negative
difference between the expected <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> trajectories.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Thenceforth, when you see the phrase “The First Common Sense
Assumption" in quotation marks, the above is the definition of that
phrase.</p>
<p>I am sure you are currently wondering “What is the Second Common
Sense Assumption." It is the assumption that both the ordinary layperson
and astute mathematician would make in an election where “Democrats
prefer to Vote by Mail."</p>
<p>The First Common Sense Assumption is <span
style="color: red">NOT</span> incompatible with an election where a
particular party prefers to cast their ballots in a particular mode.
Remember that <span class="math inline">$m_{b}=\frac{Republican
Early}{Republican Early + Republican Mail}$</span> or <span
class="math inline">$m_{b}=\frac{Republican Election Day}{Republican
Election Day + Republican Mail}$</span>; and that, <span
class="math inline">$n_{b}=\frac{Democrat Early}{Democrat Early +
Democrat Mail}$</span> or <span
class="math inline">$n_{b}=\frac{Democrat Election Day}{Democrat
Election Day + Democrat Mail}$</span>.</p>
<p>Thus the <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> percentages measure the preference
of each party’s voter base to cast their ballot by one mode or another.
We now ask our Fifth Grader the following question.</p>
<p>“In Clark County, Democrats have a 35% chance, <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub><em>b</em></sub></span>, to cast
their ballot Early, as opposed to by Mail, where Republicans have 62%,
<span class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub><em>b</em></sub></span>, chance
to cast their ballot Early. Would you expect these chances to change
significantly accordingly to exact location in which people live in
Clark County?" The Fifth Grader will respond “No, why would Democrats or
Republicans have different preferences from other Democrats or
Republicans in the same county? I can’t think of any reason why."</p>
<p>The graduate student will respond “The mean percentage of <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> will be flat across the precincts
when sorted by either <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em>, <em>y</em></span> or <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>. The only time we would expected
to see a significant rise or fall of both <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> is if—and only if—a large
<strong>consecutive</strong> sequence of precincts along the quantiles
of <span class="math inline"><em>x</em>, <em>y</em></span> or <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> had a uniform and wildly different
geography or demographic from the other precincts in the same county,
and such that, when the precincts exit this region of the <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em>, <em>y</em></span> or <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> quantiles, that the expected
trajectory of <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> shall return to their flat
trajectory at <span class="math inline"><em>m</em> = 0.62</span> and
<span class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 0.35</span> in the example you
provided for me of Clark County. In general, the trajectory of <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> should be flat, especially if the
mean value of <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> is bounded
between 25% and 75%, since both forms of voting represent a sample size
of at least 25% of an Electorate with hundreds of thousands, if not
millions, of voters."</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Definition 14</strong>. <em><span>The Second Common Sense
Assumption</span></em></p>
<p><em>That the preference of Republicans and Democrats to vote on

<span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>, assuming that the mean
value of <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> is bounded between
25% and 75%, since this implies that the two distinct modes of voting
represented by <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> both contain a sufficiently large
sample size of the electorate making up the modes respective to <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and <span

<p><em>More specifically, if neither <span

<span class="math inline"><em>x</em>, <em>y</em></span> or <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>, then they must remain parallel,
since this would imply a continuous change in a particular and
politically neutral demographic (such as age) over the quantiles of
<span class="math inline"><em>x</em>, <em>y</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>, which should effect <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and <span

demographics (such as age), should affect the electorate of both parties

<p>Thenceforth when you see the term “The Second Common Sense
Assumption" the above is the definition of that term. Below is the link
to Bard’s Response to this same question: <a
href="https://g.co/bard/share/681eaac9df9c"
class="uri">https://g.co/bard/share/681eaac9df9c</a> The below picture
is how both ordinary people (left) and mathematicians (right) depict the
First and Second Common Sense Assumptions. Notice the general
similarity.</p>
<p>The ordinary person tends to be quite confident that the picture they
drew accurately represents a fair election where Democrats prefer to
vote by mail from <span
class="math inline">0.1 &lt; <em>x</em> &lt; 0.9</span>, even though
they often admit they don’t know how to deal with the corners of the

draw the same general picture for the range of <span

<span class="math inline"><em>m</em>, <em>n</em></span> and <span

both ordinary people and academics draw them. As for dealing with the
corners of the unit square, they all agree that the local eigenvector
will be at 45 degrees from <span
class="math inline">0.3 &lt; <em>x</em> &lt; 0.7</span>, and will start
to bend upwards from <span
class="math inline">0.7 &lt; <em>x</em> &lt; 0.9</span>, and downwards
from <span class="math inline">0.1 &lt; <em>x</em> &lt; 0.3</span>.</p>
<p>I then provide the following equation to them (and display it) and
ask them if it matches what they’d expect in a fair election where
Democrats prefer to vote by mail with a 8% lead in the mail-in
percentage. Almost all agree upon seeing the trajectory (and the rest
agree after a short discussion!), and furthermore all agree that the
actual corners of the unit square will behave erratically (thus the
ordinary person was right in their refusal to draw the corner behavior).

class="uri">https://chat.openai.com/share/3ab88b2e-515c-475b-bc36-0e3067ba5cb0</a></p>
<p>Both AI’s were asked the same exact question (where z takes the place
of <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> and p takes the place of
<span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> so I could write the
question without special formatting):</p>
<p><em>“Let A be Alice’s Election Day Vote (who is a Republican) at a
precinct, let B be Bob’s Election Day Vote (who is a Democrat) at the
same precinct, let C be Alice’s Mail-in Vote at the same precinct, and
let D be Bob’s Mail in Vote, at the same precinct.</em></p>
<p><em>Let m=A/(A+C) be the percentage of Republicans that prefer to
vote on election day at that precinct.</em></p>
<p><em>Let n=B/(B+D) be the percentage of Democrats that prefer to vote
on election day at that precinct.</em></p>
<p><em>Let z = (A+C)/(A+B+C+D) be Alice’s Aggregate Percentage at that
precinct.</em></p>
<p><em>I would now like you to evaluate my stance on these three
questions:</em></p>
<p><em>Question One: Since Democrats prefer to vote by mail, we expect
<span class="math inline"><em>n</em> &lt; <em>m</em></span> across a
dataset of precincts. However, if the precincts are sorted by either
their x,y, or z values, we should expect the trajectories of m and n to
be flat over the quantiles of x,y and z since the quantiles of x,y, and
z ignore any sorting geography and demographics, correct?</em></p>
<p><em>Additional context for Question One: This of course is assuming
that p=(A+B)/(A+B+C+D) has a mean value between 25% and 75%, such that
the election day vote and the mail-in vote both represent at least 25%
of the electorate (if the mean value of p goes outside these boundaries,
then either the election day vote or the mail-in vote may not fairly
represent the entire voting base).</em></p>
<p><em>Question Two: Also, assuming that the mean value of p remains
within the boundaries of 25% to 75%, we would expect the x and y values
to be relatively equal over the precincts, since if someone got 0% of
the election day vote (x), we would expect them to get around 0% of the
mail-in vote, or, if they got 100% of the election day vote (meaning
their opponent got 0% of the election day vote), then would expect them
to get around 100% of the mail-in vote (meaning we expect their opponent
to get around 0% of the mail-in vote).</em></p>
<p><em>Thus, even though there might be a small negative difference of x
and y across the precincts (say 5% to 10%), we would expect the
eigenvector of the (x,y) data points to be around 45 degrees,
correct?</em></p>
<p><em>Third Question: Also, is it reasonable to expect the trajectory
of x to be parallel to y (that is, even if they have an average mean
difference, we still expect a 45 degree relationship between x and y) in
a fair election? Without such a relationship, we could end up in
situation where a candidate gets 0% of the election day vote and 0% of
the mail in one precinct, while getting 100% of the election day vote
but only 60% of the mail-in vote at another precincts (meaning their
opponent magically receives 40% of mail-in vote, even though they got 0%
of the election day vote at the same precinct)."</em></p>
<p>Bard’s Response was follows:</p>
<p><em>“Your stance on these three questions is sound.</em></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong> One<br />
<em>You are correct that we expect <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em> &lt; <em>m</em></span> across a dataset
of precincts, since Democrats prefer to vote by mail. This is because
Democrats are more likely to be young, minority, or have disabilities,
all of which are groups that are more likely to vote by mail.</em></p>
<p><em>If the precincts are sorted by either their x, y, or z values, we
should expect the trajectories of m and n to be flat over the quantiles
of x, y, and z. This is because the quantiles of x, y, and z ignore any
sorting geography and demographics, so they should not affect the
relationship between m and n.</em></p>
<p><strong>Question Two</strong><br />
<em>You are also correct that we would expect the x and y values to be
relatively equal over the precincts. This is because the x and y values
are both measures of the same thing: the overall popularity of a
candidate. If a candidate is popular, they are likely to do well in both
the election day vote and the mail-in vote.</em></p>
<p><em>Even though there might be a small negative difference of x and y
across the precincts, we would still expect the eigenvector of the (x,
y) data points to be around 45 degrees. This is because the eigenvector
of a data set is a line that best represents the overall trend of the
data. In this case, the overall trend of the data is that x and y are
relatively equal, so the eigenvector should be around 45
degrees.</em></p>
<p><strong>Question Three</strong><br />
<em>Yes, it is reasonable to expect the trajectory of <span
style="color: red">x to be parallel to y in a fair election</span>. This
is because, in a <span style="color: red">fair election</span>, the
overall popularity of a candidate should <span style="color: red">not
affect how they do in the election day vote or the mail-in vote</span>.
If a candidate is popular, they should do well in both votes.</em></p>
<p><em>If the trajectory of x is not parallel to y, it could be a sign
of voter suppression or <span style="color: red">fraud</span>. For
example, if a candidate is only able to do well in the election day
vote, it could be because they are only able to get their supporters to
vote on election day. This could be due to voter suppression efforts
that make it difficult for people to vote by mail.</em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: red">Overall, your stance on these three
questions is sound</span>. You have correctly identified the
relationships between m, n, x, y, and z, <span style="color: red">and
you have explained why these relationships are important in a fair
election."</span></em></p>
<p>Here is ChatGPT’s response: <em>“To evaluate your stance on these
three questions, let’s analyze each question individually:</em></p>
<p><em>Question One: Your statement seems to be on the right track.
Since Democrats prefer to vote by mail, it is reasonable to expect that
the percentage of Democrats who vote on Election Day (n) will be lower
than the percentage of Republicans who vote on Election Day (m) across
the dataset of precincts. This is because more Democrats choose to vote
by mail instead of in person on Election Day.</em></p>
<p><em>Now, regarding the sorting of precincts by their x, y, or z
values: Yes, when sorting precincts based on their x, y, or z values
(which seem to represent different factors, like geography,
demographics, and voting preferences), the trajectories of m and n
should be relatively flat over the quantiles of x, y, and z. This is
because the quantiles divide the data into equal parts, disregarding
specific characteristics of individual precincts. As a result, the
relative proportions of Republicans and Democrats who prefer to vote on
Election Day should remain roughly consistent across these
quantiles.</em></p>
<p><em>Additional context: Your assumption about the mean value of p
being between 25% and 75% is essential to ensure that both the Election
Day vote and mail-in vote fairly represent a substantial portion of the
electorate.</em></p>
<p><em>Question Two: Your reasoning here is sound. If we assume that the
mean value of p remains within the boundaries of 25% to 75%, it would
make sense for the x and y values (percentage of Election Day votes and
Mail-in votes for candidates) to be relatively equal over the precincts.
This assumption is based on the idea that the proportion of voters who
prefer to vote in person (x) should have some level of correlation with
the proportion of voters who prefer to vote by mail (y) for a given
candidate.</em></p>
<p><em>While there might be a small negative difference between x and y
across precincts, the eigenvector (a mathematical term related to
eigenvalues and eigenvectors) that represents the relationship between
the (x, y) data points should indeed be around 45 degrees. A 45-degree
angle indicates a positive correlation between x and y, meaning that as
one increases, the other tends to increase as well.</em></p>
<p><em>Third Question: Yes, it is reasonable to expect the trajectory of
x to be parallel to y (a 45-degree relationship between x and y) in a
fair election. This assumption is based on the idea that the proportion
of Election Day votes (x) and the proportion of mail-in votes (y) should
be somewhat consistent for a given candidate across different precincts.
<span style="color: red">In a fair election, the relationship between
these two voting methods should follow some pattern.</span></em></p>
<p><em>Without such a relationship (i.e., x and y having a random or no
correlation), the situation you described could occur, where a candidate
gets 0% of the Election Day vote and 0% of the mail-in vote in one
precinct, but 100% of the Election Day vote and only 60% of the mail-in
vote in another precinct. This scenario would raise concerns about the
fairness and integrity of the election results, <span
style="color: red">as it could indicate potential anomalies or
manipulations.</span></em></p>
<p><em>In summary, your stances on these questions seem reasonable and
demonstrate an understanding of how the voting preferences of different
groups and the relationships between voting methods <span
style="color: red">should behave across precincts in a fair
election.</span>"</em></p>
<p>So, not only does both the common man (who would be on a jury) and an
academic (who would be an expert witness) on street agree with the two
common sense assumptions, but the AI’s agree as well.</p>
<p><strong>Do you know why? <span style="color: red">Because it’s common
sense!</span></strong></p>
<h2
id="how-the-clark-washoe-and-atlanta-ga-election-defy-the-common-sense-assumption">How
the Clark, Washoe and Atlanta (GA) election Defy the Common Sense
Assumption</h2>
<p>Let us see if the 2020 Elections of Clark and Washoe Counties, match
what we would expect in a Fair Election where Democrats Prefer to Vote
by Mail. The term “Bowshock" in the below diagrams means the maximum
distance between the Early Percentage and the trajectory of the Mail-in
Percentage.</p>
<p>Notice that <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> is constantly
decreasing which means more Democrats vote by Mail in Republican
Precincts. Notice that the distance from <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> to the trajectory of <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> keeps increasing, maxing out at
31%, which means that Republicans suffer more in the mail the better
they perform in the Early Vote. Such monstrosities are the
<strong>forced</strong> result of an election that was rigged with a
flat plane of <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>α</em></span> (setting
<span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> constant over the
precincts), due to the Twenty Laws and Forty Isometries. We’ll cover
this in the final section of this chapter.</p>

Geometric Absurdity of Constant Lambda; Why the Defense Cannot Assert
that Constant Lambda is not unusual in a Safe and Secure Election; And
Why Lambda is Called the “Obstacle Percentage"</h2>
<p>Usually by this point in the presentation to the common layman, where
I’ve shown the <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> decreases
with <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, that the distance
between <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> diverges with <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, that Biden’s Mail-in Vote can be
calculated knowing only the Total Ballots Cast and Trump’s early Vote,
and that <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em> = 0.635<em>g</em> + 0.365<em>h</em></span>,
allowing you to calculate <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> in
every precinct with no knowledge of <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> (violating the Fish Tank Paradox)
in every precinct, the common lay person admits (and Bard and ChatGPT
AI’s) that it’s a foregone conclusion that the Nevada election has been
rigged.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, “credentialed mathematicians" continue to
protest and say (with no reasons given) that it there’s nothing wrong
with constant <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> across the
precincts, even though they will readily admit that there would be
something wrong with constant <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> or constant <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> across the precincts.</p>
<p>I finally say, “Let us assume that Lambda is indeed constant across
the precincts, and, as you said, there’s nothing unusual about that,
then you’re saying that how Republicans perform in the Early Vote and
how Republicans prefer to cast their ballots will <strong>FORCE</strong>
how Democrats cast their ballots across the precinct."</p>
<p>You’d be surprised how many academics (who are majority left leaning)
don’t realize the gravity of the previous statement. They think I’m
talking about statistical trends...but I’m not, I’m talking about
geometry, I’m talking about the Twenty Laws and Forty Isometries.</p>
<p>You see, if one knows <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span>
and <span class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub>1</sub></span>, then the
remaining six percentages, <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>α</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>Ω</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>n</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>g</em><sub>1</sub></span>
and <span class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub>1</sub></span> are also
known, because their existence is <strong>forced</strong>. If one knows
the proportion of <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> to <span
class="math inline"><em>u</em></span>, the proportion of <span
class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> to <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> and the proportion of <span
class="math inline">(<em>s</em>+<em>v</em>)</span> to <span
class="math inline">(<em>s</em>+<em>v</em>) + (<em>u</em>+<em>t</em>)</span>,
then they know the proportions of all combinations of <span
class="math inline"><em>s</em>, <em>t</em>, <em>u</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>v</em></span>.</p>
<p>The Twenty Laws and Forty Isometries are just a collection of 60
general laws amongst a grand total of 1,008 Laws (equal to 2 times 9
times 8 Choose 3), that allow you to calculate any percentage (or its
conserved partner) from any other three percentages of the remaining
eight (whilst using the conserved values of the remaining eight
percentages where needed to simply the equations).</p>
<p>The reason that I selected those particular Twenty Laws (and their
respective Forty Isometries), is because they describe the immediate
behavior between percentages confined to the same Orientation (North vs
South, West vs East and Diagonal vs Diagonal)—but that doesn’t mean
there aren’t other laws that (for instance), allow you to solve for
<span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> or <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> knowing <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>, where <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> are quadrant pairing percentages
from different Orientations.</p>

<p>You may be surprised that <strong>some</strong> academics up to this
point in presentation (article), will still continue to resist. They
will claim that perhaps the election day percentage (or the early
percentage), <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span>, is
not the proper description of the election (meaning the horizontal axis
shouldn’t be <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span> or
the quantiles of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span>), and will then
discard the previous three Perversion Theorems and spout some Main
Stream Media nonsense of how Democrats prefer to vote by mail.</p>
<p>After they’re done saying whatever it is they want to say (which they
cannot even put in concrete mathematical terms, and refuse to put in
concrete mathematical terms) , I then show the the <span
class="math inline">46<sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> Isometry,
which is the Diagonal vs Diagonal Isometry of the <span
class="math inline">6<sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> Law, which
itself is the Hyperbolic Reflection Theorem.</p>
<p>The power of the <span
class="math inline">46<sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> Isometry is
that it <strong>temporarily concedes</strong> the argument that either
the <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and/or <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> percentages are not the proper
description of the election, thus we use <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> to describe the election...after
all, no one, including these academics, can disagree that <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> properly describes the
election—for the winner of an election is determined by <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>. (one of my friends joked “If
Emperor Palpatine was the Alpha Percentage, he would exclaim ‘I am the
Election!’")</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p><strong>Theorem 9</strong>. <em><span>The Fourth Perversion Theorem,

\implies
n_{2}=\lambda_{1}+\frac{\alpha_{1}}{\alpha_{2}}(\lambda_1-m_{1})$$</span></em></p>
<p><em>This states that the percentage of Democrats that prefer to vote
by mail, <span class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub>2</sub></span>, as
opposed to Early (remember that <span
class="math inline">$n_{2}=\frac{Democrat Mail}{Democrat Early+Democrat
Mail}$</span>), is the reflection of <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub>1</sub></span>, which is the
percentage of Republicans that prefer to vote Early, over the line of
<span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>, scaled by proportion of
total Republican to total Democrat ballots.</em></p>
<p><em>Thus if <span class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub>1</sub></span>
is parallel to <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span>
in respect to <span class="math inline"><em>α</em><sub>1</sub></span> or
the quantiles of <span

class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub>2</sub> &gt; <em>m</em><sub>1</sub></span>
and the <span class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub>2</sub></span> must
increase exponentially, the better than Republicans perform overall,
<span class="math inline"><em>α</em><sub>1</sub></span>. Furthermore the
more Republicans that prefer to vote early (as <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub>1</sub></span> increases, and
therefore <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span> also
increases since they are parallel), the more Democrats <strong>ARE
FORCED</strong> to vote by mail.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Thus after the academics are done digging their graves about
Republican Early/Election Day turnout being higher in Republican
precincts (increasing <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub>1</sub></span>), I then show them
that it translates to, directly, increased Democrat turnout by mail in
those very same high performing Republican precincts. In the below
graphs, as <span class="math inline"><em>α</em><sub>1</sub></span>
increases (the white line), that if <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub>1</sub></span> (which is the
percentage of Republicans that prefer to vote Early, instead of by mail)
is parallel to <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span>,
that <span class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub>2</sub></span>, which is
the percentage of Democrats that prefer to vote by Mail, as opposed to
Early, cannot be less than <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span>, and thus must always
be greater than <span class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub>1</sub></span>,
because <span class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub>2</sub></span> is the
reflection of <span class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub>1</sub></span>
over <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span>.</p>
<p>This also means that the more energy there is in the Republican
electorate (the more they turnout to vote on election day or early at
precinct), the more energy there is in the Democrat electorate to turn
out by mail in Republican precincts. You can see this in the bottom two
graphs (bottom left and bottom center), where I put <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span> on positive incline in
respect to <span class="math inline"><em>α</em><sub>1</sub></span>,
which forces <span class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub>2</sub></span> to
explode (bottom center), and the distance between <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>1</sub></span> (which are the Early
and Mail-in Percentages for the Republicans) to diverge within the range
of <span class="math inline">0 ≤ <em>α</em><sub>1</sub> ≤ 0.7</span>,
creating a massive bowshock!</p>

<p>After showing an academic the “Alpha Reflection," you would think
they would finally concede. Each time they’ve moved the goalposts (such
as using <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> instead of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> to describe the election), I’ve
struck them down using pure geometry...but alas, they have one last
“trick up their sleeve" in an attempt to deny the absurdity of <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> diverging.</p>
<p>They (the few academics who continue resisting) will each
independently (since I talk to them in isolation) show me the below
graph (top-left) of <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>
increasing with <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>. They will
then proclaim that that I am wrong and that the Democrat <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> does not decrease with the
Republican <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>, yet all they are
doing is show me an orthogonal projection <strong>(an optical illusion—a
lie)</strong> of the <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em>, <em>n</em>, <em>α</em></span>
coordinates onto the <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em>, <em>n</em></span> plane.</p>
<p>You see the Ninth Law, via the <span
class="math inline">49<sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> Isometry,
states the that <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> can all exist independently from
0% to 100%, viz. <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em> = <em>m</em><em>α</em> + (1−<em>α</em>)<em>n</em></span>.
Thus showing us the top-left graph doesn’t tell us anything about the
election, because <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> alone don’t resolve the
proportions of <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> to <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> to <span

class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span>, since <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> must exist between <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>, which places <strong>wide
boundaries</strong> on <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>α</em></span>
and <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, knowledge of <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> is meaningless without knowledge
of <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>...and they know that.
Because if they don’t know that, they shouldn’t have a math degree—thus
they are intentionally obfuscating in an attempt to deceive us; hence
why I called it a “trick up their sleeve."</p>

<p>In the top-left and top-right graphs show the same (nearly flat)
trajectory for <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span>
(in orange) in respect to the Early Percentage (or election day
percentage), <span

<p>The Sixth Law prevents the Democrat’s mail-in percentage, <span

<span class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span>, until the
Republican Early Percentage exceeds <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span>, since <span

<span class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span>, scaled by <span
class="math inline">$\frac{\Omega_{1}}{\Omega_{2}}$</span>, regardless
of the value <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em><sub>1</sub></span>
(notice the trajectories of <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em><sub>1</sub></span> are different in the
top-left and top-right graphs, yet the Democrat Mail-in Percentage
cannot fall below <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span> until <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span>).</p>
<p>In the bottom-left and bottom-right graphs I placed the trajectory of
<span class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span> on a higher
incline, while using the same two trajectories for <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em><sub>1</sub></span> from the top-left and
top-right graphs, respectively. Notice again that regardless of the
value of <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em><sub>1</sub></span>, that
the Democrat Mail-in Percentage, <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>2</sub></span> cannot fall below
<span class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span> until <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span> exceeds <span

<p>Also, observe the Bowshocks (the maximum distance between <span

<span class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>1</sub></span>) in each of the

<p>For the Contrarians or Deceivers (it becomes difficult to tell the
difference between contrarians and deceivers once I am this deep into
the presentation), that oppose the diagram of the Sixth Law (which they
technically can’t oppose, because it’s geometry), on the grounds that
the Early Percentage (or election day percentage), <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span>, may not be the proper
horizontal axis to describe the election, we have the Fourth and Eighth
Laws which use <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> as the
horizontal axis.</p>
<p>The below graphs focus primarily on the Eighth Law, since the Fourth
Law concerns the value of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span> in respect to <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span>
and <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em><sub>1</sub></span>.</p>
<p>We know from the Twixt Lemma that <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em><sub>1</sub></span> must exist between
<span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>1</sub></span>, and since the
trajectory of <span class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>1</sub></span> is
below <span class="math inline"><em>α</em><sub>1</sub></span> in the
below graphs, we know that <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span> is above <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em><sub>1</sub></span>.</p>
<p>Under the Eighth Law, the Republicans cannot achieve more than 50% of
the Mail-in Vote, <span

Eight Problems of the 2020 Election of Trump vs Biden in Clark and
Washoe Counties</h2>
<p>We shall temporarily dispense with the terms “North, South, West,
East and Diagonal vs Diagonal" for the remainder of this chapter.</p>
<p>So allow me to state, in Plain English, as I would to the General
Public and the Citizens of a Jury, the Eight Main Problems in Clark and
Washoe Counties in the 2020 Election of Trump vs Biden (these extend to
the 2022 Primaries and the 2022 General Election of 2022, and there’s
even more problems in places like Atlanta (Georgia), Will County
(Illinois), Macomb and Oakland Counties (Michigan), Maricopa (Arizona)
and Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), where we find highly curved and
deterministic manifolds of <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>α</em>)</span></p>
<p>Let S be Trump’s Early Vote at a precinct (a precinct is a voting
station), let T be Biden’s Early Vote at the same precinct, let U be
Trump’s Mail-in vote at the same precinct, let V be Biden’s Mail-in Vote
at the same precinct. Let K be the sum of all ballots cast at the
precinct, K=S+T+U+V.</p>
<p>Let <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>α</em></span>
be the Election Percentages, since they describe Trump’s Early
Percentage, Trump’s Mail-in Percentage, Biden’s Mail-in Percentage and
Trump’s Total Percentage in each precinct, where:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">$x=\frac{S}{S+T}; y=\frac{U}{U+V};
c=\frac{V}{U+V}; \alpha=\frac{S+U}{K}$</span></p>
<p>Let <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em>, <em>n</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>Ω</em></span>
be the Preference Percentages, since they describe the percentage of
Trump Voters to cast their ballot early, percentage of Biden Voters to
cast their ballot early, percentage of Biden Voters to cast their ballot
by mail, and the percentage of all Voters who prefer to cast their
ballot early, respectively.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">$m=\frac{S}{S+U}; n=\frac{T}{T+V};
c=\frac{V}{T+V}; \Omega=\frac{S+T}{K}$</span></p>
<p>Let <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>λ</em></span> be the
Strange Percentages, since they are the remaining three percentages
which have no verbal description, as they do not represent a particular
preference or behavior of the electorate. These percentages exist only
as mathematical abstractions, and should have no significance in a fair
election.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">$g=\frac{S}{S+V}$</span> be the
percentage of ballots cast that are Trump Early ballots amongst Trump
Early and Biden Mail-in Ballots at the precinct.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">$h=\frac{U}{U+T}$</span> be the percentage
of ballots cast that are Trump Mail-in ballots amongst Trump Mail-in and
Biden Early Ballots at the precinct.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">$\lambda=\frac{S+V}{K}$</span> be the
Percentage of all Ballots Cast that are either Trump Early Ballots or
Biden Mail-in Ballots at the precinct. In accordance to the above
definitions of <span
class="math inline"><em>S</em>, <em>T</em>, <em>U</em>, <em>V</em>, <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>m</em>, <em>n</em>, <em>α</em>, <em>Ω</em>, <em>λ</em>, <em>c</em></span>
and <span class="math inline"><em>d</em></span>, the following eight
problems arise in Clark and Washoe Counties, in the 2022 General
Election of Trump vs Biden, which, beyond all reasonable doubt, conclude
that the election was manipulated. Each of these problems arise from the
fact that <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> is generally
invariant over the precincts, with a mean value of 63.5% with a small
standard deviation of 3%.</p>
<p>First Problem: That since <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>
is invariant, it means we can calculate K knowing only S and V, that is
K=(1/0.635)(S+V), which means the total ballots cast was determined by
Trump’s Early Vote and Biden’s Mail-in Vote, which is impossible because
Trump’s Mail-in Vote and Biden’s Early Vote have yet to be counted. This
places a restriction on Trump’s Mail-in Vote, that it can never exceed
36.5% of all ballots cast, while Biden’s Mail-in Vote can go to 63.5% of
all ballots cast. This is tremendous barrier for Trump, since he must
perform incredibly in the Early Vote to win the election.</p>
<p>Second Problem: That since <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> is invariant, it means we can
calculate Biden’s Mail-in Vote, V, knowing only K and S, that is
V=63.5%K-S, and this formula has an <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.98</span> across the
1286 precincts. This is impossible because it means that the total
ballots cast, K, determined Biden’s Mail-in Vote, V, before Biden’s
Mail-in Vote was known, yet K, the Total Ballots Cast, cannot have been
known until after all ballots were cast, including Biden’s Mail-in
ballots, V, in each precinct.</p>
<p>Third Problem: The invariance of <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> itself is a concern, because it
does not represent a preference or behavior of the voters. Imagine that
<span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> was invariant over the
precincts, this would be very strange, as it would state that in every
precinct, Trump got the same percentage of the vote...but at least we
can put this strange scenario in words. Likewise if <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> was invariant over the precincts,
it would also be strange, as it would state that in every precinct, the
preference to vote Early was same, yet again we can at least put this
strange scenario in words. However, there is no way to comprehend the
meaning of <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> being invariant
over the precincts, because <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>
does not even represent a preference or behavior of the voters. This
makes the invariance of <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> very
suspicious. How could the voters of Nevada make such a uniform decision
across all 1286 precincts in Clark and Washoe Counties, two
demographically different and distant counties on opposite sides of the
State of Nevada? Even more distressing is that this a uniform decision
that does not even represent a particular preference or behavior of the
voters! Lambda is supposed to be a pure mathematical abstraction, not an
actual entity that describes the election!</p>
<p>Fourth Problem: That <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em> = <em>g</em><em>λ</em> + (1−<em>λ</em>)<em>h</em></span>.
However, since <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> is invariant
over the precincts, we have <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em> = <em>g</em>(0.635) + (0.365)<em>h</em></span>
for every precinct. This formula has an <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> exceeding 0.995 over
all 1286 precincts. This means that the <span
class="math inline">(<em>g</em>,<em>h</em>,<em>z</em>)</span>
coordinates collapse to a flat plane, instead of a 3D Gaussian cloud of
probability, since in a fair election, <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> alone cannot determine <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>, without knowledge of <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>, yet in this election we can solve
for <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> with from only <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> with no knowledge of any
precinct’s <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>.</p>
<p>Fifth Problem: That <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em> = <em>g</em><em>λ</em> + (1−<em>λ</em>)<em>h</em></span>
However, since <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> is invariant
over the precincts, we have <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em> = <em>g</em>(0.635) + (0.365)<em>h</em></span>
for every precinct. This formula has an <span
class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span> exceeding 0.995 over
all 1286 precincts. This means that the <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> percentages, which don’t even
represent a preference or behavior of the voters, have formed a
deterministic manifold that yields Trump’s Aggregate Percentage in each
precinct, that allows us to solve for <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> without knowledge of <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>. It is <strong>incredibly
damning</strong> that the Election of 2020 can be described
deterministically in terms of <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span>, when neither <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em></span> nor <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> describe a particular behavior or
preference of the voters.</p>
<p>Sixth Problem: That <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>,
which is Biden’s Mail-in percentage, can be expressed as <span
class="math inline">$c=\lambda+(\frac{\Omega}{1-\Omega})(\lambda-x)$</span>,
which is the geometric relationship between <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em>, <em>w</em>, <em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span>. It states that <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> is the reflection of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> over the value of <span
class="math inline"><em>w</em></span>, scaled by <span
class="math inline">$\frac{\Omega}{1-\Omega}$</span>. Thus when <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = <em>λ</em></span>, then <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em> = <em>λ</em></span>, therefore <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = <em>c</em></span> if and only if <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = <em>λ</em></span>. Thus, since <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> is invariant over the precincts
with a mean value of 63.5%, this geometric relationship says that Biden
cannot get less than 63.5% of the mail-in vote in any precinct until
Trump gets more than 63.5% of the Early Vote, and when Trump does
achieve this, that he will still only have 36.5% of the mail-in vote,
geometrically forcing a 27% difference between Trump’s Early and Mail-in
Percentages. More generally, the invariance of <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> (and the fact that <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> is on a slight positive incline in
respect to <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>) at 63.5% causes
the difference between <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and
<span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> (Trump’s Early and Mail-in
Percentages) to grow continuously, meaning the better Trump performs in
the Early Vote, the more Trump suffers in the Mail-in Vote, regardless
of the value of <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span>, which is
the percentage of all voters that cast their ballots early.</p>
<p>Seventh Problem: That <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>,
which is Biden’s Mail-in Percentage, can be expressed as <span
class="math inline">$c=\frac{\lambda-\alpha+(1-\Omega)}{2(1-\Omega)}$</span>,
and that <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>, which is Trump’s
Mail-in Percentage, can be expressed as <span
class="math inline">$c=\frac{(1-\lambda)+\alpha-\Omega}{2(1-\Omega)}$</span>,
which states that <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em> = <em>y</em> = 50%</span>, if, and only
if, <span class="math inline"><em>α</em> = <em>λ</em></span>. However,
since <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> is invariant over the
precincts at 63.5%, it means that Trump must acquire at least 63.5% of
the total vote, before his mail-in percentage can exceed 50%. This
places an nearly insurmountable obstacle in Trump’s way, since he must
perform extremely well (well beyond 63.5%) in the Early Vote to achieve
an aggregate percentage of 63.5%.</p>
<p>Eighth Problem:That <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>,
which is percentage of Democrats that prefer to vote Early, can be
expressed as <span
class="math inline">$n=\frac{(1-\lambda)(1-x)m}{\lambda
x+m(1-2x)}$</span>. In the 2020 election, the trajectories of <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>w</em></span> were parallel in respect to <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> (with a mean difference less than
3% between their trajectories), and since <span
class="math inline"><em>w</em></span> has a mean value of 63.5% with no
meaningful variation, it forces <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> to decreases rapidly with <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, meaning the Democrat mail-in
turnout increases rapidly as Republicans perform better in the early
vote.</p>
<p>From these Eight Problems, we can conclude, beyond a reasonable
doubt, the 2020 General Election of Trump vs Biden in Clark and Washoe
Counties, Nevada, was rigged.</p>
<p>We can also conclude, beyond all reasonable doubt the either one of
the following two mechanisms were used to achieve this uniformity of
<span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> over the precincts (which
caused all of this erratic behavior), and follow from the fact the
linear regression of K (the total number of Early and Mail-in Ballots
cast at a precinct) in terms of S and V (Trump’s Early Vote and Biden’s
Mail-in Vote) was <span
class="math inline"><em>K</em> = 1.4243<em>S</em> + 1.6862<em>V</em></span>,
with an <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.988</span>
with a coefficient of multiple correlation of 0.994.</p>
<p>Mechanism One (least likely): That the Total Ballots Cast was
determined by Trump’s Early Vote and Biden’s Mail-in Vote, and then a
great portion of Trump’s Mail-in Vote was deleted to achieve the new
Total Ballots Cast.</p>
<p>Mechanism Two (more likely), that when the total ballots cast was
known, that Biden’s Mail-in Vote, V, was reset via the formula <span
class="math inline">$V=\frac{K-1.42433S}{1.6862}=0.5930K-0.8446S$</span>,
and that the requisite number of Trump Mail-in ballots were
intentionally miscounted as Biden Mail-in Ballots until the new number
for V was achieved. The constants of the formula were chosen to achieve
a statewide victory for Biden, using the two most populated counties,
Clark and Washoe, on opposite sides of the State Nevada, to counteract
the result in the other counties and to counteract the overwhelming
legitimate popularity of Trump in Clark and Washoe Counties.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that this formula: <span
class="math inline"><em>V</em> = 0.5930<em>K</em> − 0.8446<em>S</em></span>
will in fact produce a small artificial variation in <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> and create the slightly inclined
of the trajectory of <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> in
respect to <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>, and also cause <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> to be nearly parallel the
trajectory of <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> with a small
difference around 3% between their trajectories, which was observed in
the actual election, and also leads to a massive divergence between the
Early and Mail-in Percentages as <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> increase and massive increase in
Democrat Mail-in Turnout, <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em><sub>2</sub></span>, as <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> increase, and also creates the
observed Cubic Torsion in the Manifold of <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>α</em></span> (that is,
the manifold of <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>α</em></span> is not
perfectly flat, but rather curved, although nearly imperceptible to the
human eye). Mechanism Three (most probable): That, when taking into
consideration the curved manifolds of <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>α</em></span> in other
States, such as Illinois, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Arizona,
and the fact that the manifold of <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>α</em></span> in Nevada
also has slight curvature (which produces a small artificial variation
in <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>, and the fact that these
manifolds are quaternionic in Illinois and Nevada in 2022 (a
quaternionic manifold that rigs four countywide/statewide races at a
time), that a Hypercomplex Valued Neural Network, also known as an HVNN
(or an ELM for Extreme Learning Machine), manipulated the individual
values of <span class="math inline"><em>g</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> in each precinct, and set <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>p</em><em>h</em><em>a</em></span>
accordingly to a manifold formula, to minimize the following Cost
Function across the precincts:</p>
<p>Cost One: To minimize the difference between the Republican Aggregate
Performance in the previous election cycle to the manifold value of
<span
class="math inline"><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>p</em><em>h</em><em>a</em></span>
in the current election, in each precinct.</p>
<p>Cost Two: A Countywide Cost on the angular value of the principal
<span class="math inline"><em>m</em>, <em>n</em></span> eigenvector, in
order to perpetuate the myth the Democrats prefer to vote by mail, while
not caring about the 3D principal eigenvector of <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em>, <em>n</em>, <em>α</em></span>.</p>
<p>Cost Three: The minimize the number of ballots created, destroyed, or
flipped at each precinct by distributing the entire load of the
fraudulent ballots over the precincts in respect to the number of
registered voters (which is the algorithmic size of the precinct).</p>
<p>Cost Four: At each precinct, the minimize the difference between the
<span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> values across the races of
that precinct (to ensure the same proportion of Early to Mail-in Votes
across the races at the same precinct), which is why the Quaternions are
used.</p>
<p>Cost Five: To minimize the difference in the aggregate percentages
between candidates of the same party, while slightly favoring one
candidate of the same party over another candidate in different races,
using the the quaternions to distribute the magnitude of the <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> vector disproportionately amongst
candidates of the same party in different races (which is why the
Republican, Lombardo, won the Gubernatorial Race, while the other
Republicans lost down the ballot in 2022). Cost Six: To minimize the
above costs while ensuring the the selected slate of candidates win
their respective elections (infinite cost if not fulfilled, which would
be programmed using a massive hyperbolic cost function that is
effectively zero when the result of the election is below the Automatic
Recount criteria of the State, and balloons to infinity the moment any
particular selected candidate loses).</p>
<p>We shall cover the quaternionic manifolds of Illinois 2022 and Nevada
2022 in the final chapter. Given all of the above, the Third Mechanism
is the most likely, since it explains the rig in the other States using
the same system in Nevada.</p>
<p>It is only because the manifold of Nevada was nearly flat (almost
imperceptible curvature) that the irregularities are easy to explain to
general public. I’m personally convinced it was an Act of G-d that the
cubic manifold constants of Nevada resulted in a nearly flat plane. By
Nevada’s <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>α</em></span> being
nearly flat, it caused <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> to be
nearly constant at 63.5% across the precincts.</p>
<p>In other words, the constancy of <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> was an unintended consequence of
rigging the election with a manifold that was nearly flat (thus,
peculiar to Nevada). In other rigged elections, that exhibit
eccentrically curved <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>α</em></span> manifolds,
we do not get a constant lambda, and thus the results of election cannot
be reduced in simpler terms to the general public, which is Nevada is a
G-dsend.</p>
<h2
id="what-is-the-trajectory-of-lambda-in-fair-election-no-basis-for-democrats-preferring-to-vote-by-mail">What
is the Trajectory of Lambda in Fair Election? No Basis for Democrats
Preferring To Vote by Mail</h2>
<p>A common question asked of me at this point in the presentation (or
article) is the expected trajectory of lambda in respect to <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em>, <em>y</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> in a fair election.</p>
<p>Although it’s fine for the ordinary layman to ask this question, I
sigh when this asked by credentialed mathematician, because the Twixt
Lemma, the Single Aggregate Convergence Lemma and the Irrelevance
Theorem already provides a concise answer to this question.</p>
<p>The trajectory of Lambda is bounded between the Republican Election
Day (or Early) Percentage, <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span>, and the Democrat
Mail-in Percentage, <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>2</sub></span>. The mean value of
<span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> determine the trajectory of
<span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> between <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>2</sub></span>, and the standard
deviation of <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> is tied
directly to the standard deviation of <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span>.</p>
<p>If the mean value of <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> is
50%, then the mean value of <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>
is also 50% with a flat trajectory, since it means that <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> must bisect the lines <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span>
and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>2</sub> = 1 − <em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span>.
As the mean value of <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span>
approaches 0%, <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> follows <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>2</sub></span>, and as the mean value
of <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> approaches 0%, <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> follows <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span>.</p>
<p>Before I present the graphs and tables for the expected means and
standard deviations of <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>,
these tables are made under the assumption that there is no difference
in the preference between Democrats and Republicans to cast their
ballots Early or by Mail, just as there is no difference between
Democrats and Republicans to prefer vanilla or chocolate ice-cream.</p>
<p><strong>Until someone can show me a fair election where Democrats
prefer to vote by Mail—that is an election that has no manifolds that
violate any of the Twenty Laws and Forty Isometries, nor fails a
Quantile Secant Test (Chapter Three)—and makes available the tabulations
by Counting Group (Election Day, Early and Mail-in) for each precinct
from the <span style="color: red">certified totals</span> of County
Recorder/Secretary of State/Registrar of Voters, you have <span
style="color: red">NO RIGHT TO CLAIM</span> that “Democrats Prefer to
Vote by Mail."</strong></p>
<p>PROVE IT. Find me an election where Democrats Prefer to Vote by Mail
that doesn’t have a manifold. I dare you.</p>
<p>We do science here. We do geometry. We do the Twenty Laws and Forty
Isometries. If you want to show that Democrats prefer to vote by
mail—prove it. So far all have failed, and some have been reduced to
tears after having done their own research looking for a fair election
where <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> &lt; <em>m</em></span> and
finding only deterministic manifolds of <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>α</em></span>
nationwide.</p>
<p>Until then, we shall assume that <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>y</em><sub>1</sub></span>
and <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>n</em><sub>1</sub></span>
in a fair election (more specifically, the eigenvectors are at 45
degrees with no significant offset). In the below diagram, you see the
values of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>y</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>α</em><sub>1</sub></span>
and <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em><sub>1</sub></span> (pink, blue,
purple and yellow respectively) graphed against the quantiles of <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>. In the top three graphs, the mean
value of <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> is set to 10% with
a standard deviation of 0.024%; in the center graphs, the mean value of
<span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> is set to 50% with a
standard deviation of 12%, and in the bottom three graphs the mean value
of <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> is set to 90% with a
standard deviation of 0.024%.</p>
<p>The Left graphs are Republican Landslides, where mean <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> is 70%, the Center Column of
graphs are Neutral Election, where mean <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> is 50%, and the Right Graphs are
Democrat Landslides where the mean value of <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> is 30%.</p>
<p>Notice that <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span>
(pink) residuals are wide (Irrelevance Theorem) and the <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>1</sub></span> (blue) residuals are
non-existent in the top graphs, this is because the mean value of <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> is 10%, thus <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> converge on each other, and <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>2</sub></span> converge upon each
other.</p>
<p>In the bottom graphs, where the mean value of <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> is 90% it’s the other way around,
both <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> converge on <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span>. In the center graphs,
where the mean value of <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> is
50%, both the pink and blue residuals bespangle the trajectory of <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> has a slight negative tilt,
regardless of the mean value of <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>.</p>

<p>In the below tables there two sets of Five Columns, titled “Democrat
Landslide, Democrat Win, Neutral, Republican Win, Republican Landslide,"
where the mean values of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span> are 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%
and 70% respectively, with standard deviations of 8%, 10%, 13%, 10% and
8% respectively, with a <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>1</sub></span> noise offsets of 5%,
6.5%, 8%, 6.5% and 5% respectively. You interact and experiment with
these parameters here: <a

<p>The first set of five columns displays the expected mean value of
<span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> for row (where each row
increments the mean value of <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span>
by 5% and sets the standard deviation of <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> to <span
class="math inline">0.24<em>Ω</em></span> when <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em> ≤ 50%</span>, and to <span
class="math inline">0.24(1−<em>Ω</em>)</span> when <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em> &gt; 50%</span>). The second set of five
columns show the expected standard deviation of <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> under the same conditions. Notice
that the only time that <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> has
a flat trajectory is when it has a mean value of 50% (and when the mean
value of <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> is also 50%). This
is what we expect in a fair election, because for <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> to have a flat trajectory anywhere
else (like at 63.5% in Nevada), means that one of the political parties
(Republicans in Nevada) face an <span style="color: red">Insurmountable
Obstacle to Victory</span>.</p>

<p>In Washoe County, 2004, Little Johnny the Fifth Grader needs a little
help from the PhD’s and graduate students, Bard and ChatGPT AI’s. There
is a <strong>small</strong> constant difference between the <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> percentages; however, notice that
they remain mostly parallel, meaning that non-political demographic
factors affected both the Republican and Democrat Preference percentages
at an equal rate. Notice that the bowshock of the Election Day vs Early
Vote is at a tame value between 8% and 12%, as interviewed undergrads,
grads and PhD’s predicted in their drawings (and the Chatbot AI’s!). For
the Election Day vs Mail-in Vote, we get m=n and x=y, and for the Early
vs the Mail-in vote we get parallel trajectories of m=n on a significant
decline, and thus, as a result, y=x.</p>
<p>In both Clark and Washoe, <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>
behaves as predicted in the Fair Lambda Tables/Graphs in the previous
section, such that <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> does not
act as an Obstacle against either party. We’ll discuss Clark’s 2004
<span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> on the next page.</p>

<p>The below graphs show the <span

expected (instead of the descending cubic domes of Atlanta Georgia and

<p>And here is the part that is going to surprise you, in Clark County
the <span class="math inline"><em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>α</em></span>
coordinates form a flat plane for the Election Day vs the Early
Vote—<strong>as expected,</strong> with a mean value of <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> equal to 49.52% with a standard
deviation of 03.77%. <a href="https://plotly.com/~EKSolomon/106/"
class="uri">https://plotly.com/~EKSolomon/106/</a></p>
<p>The Fair Lambda Table/Graphs clearly show us that <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> will have a mean value of 50% and
a small standard deviation around 5% and a flat trajectory over the
quantiles of <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>. Using the
specific parameters of Clark 2004, such as mean value of <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> being at 45% with a standard
deviation of 09.5%, and the mean noise of <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> being -00.6% with a standard
deviation of 05.46% and the mean value of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> being 46% with a standard
deviation of 12%, we get an expected mean value of <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> at 50.59% with a standard
deviation of 03.87%, which is pretty much equal to the actual election
results at 49.52% and 03.77%.</p>
<p>Also bear in mind that <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>
being at 50% means that is not an Obstacle to either party. All it means
is that you need 50% of the election day vote to get 50% of the mail-in
vote...like you know...in a fair election. Hence why <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> is never flat in a fair election
unless its mean value is 50%...go figure. Common Sense prevails again!

<p>Again, the wisdom of Little Johnny the Fifth Grader prevails, that
the difference between <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and
<span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> should be the same across
the precincts, and with a little help from the academics, can be said
that we expect <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> to be
parallel to <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> (that is have
the same general incline) since any inclination of either <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> or <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> must be due to non-political
demographic factors, as the average distance between <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> is already accounted for by
politically charged demographics.</p>
<p>The funny part is that I show them these graphs first, before the
2020 and 2022 graphs. It’s fun to watch dishonest academics (Deceivers)
try to wriggle their way out of the hole they dug and try to explain
away constant lambda at 63.5% with non sense terms like “Mail-in Drift"
or “Partisan Enthusiasm" that they refuse to put in concrete
mathematical terms for examination.</p>

Introduction to Complex Number Percentages and Manifolds for Two

<p>Just as the Linear Approximations of Biden’s Mail-in Vote in terms of
Total Ballots Cast and Trump’s Early Vote are watered down explanations
of the <span

down versions of quaternionic <span

<p>Since any quaternion can rewritten as a locally complex number (using
the unit vector of its imaginary <span

component), we will first start with the complex numbers themselves and
how they apply to two races.</p>
<p>Suppose we have two candidates, a Republican and Democrat, for two
races, the President and the Senate.</p>
<p>Alice and Bob are the Republican and Democrat candidates of the
Presidential Race, and Cathy and Dan are the Republican and Democrat
candidates of the Senate Race.</p>
<p>Before I state the vote total definitions, we do not recognize <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em> + <em>b</em><em>i</em></span> as a
complex number, rather we recognize <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em><em>q⃗</em> + <em>b</em><em>i⃗</em></span>
as a complex number, where <span class="math inline"><em>q⃗</em></span>
is the <span class="math inline"><em>q⃗</em></span> is the forward
vector, <span class="math inline"> − <em>q⃗</em></span> is the reverse
vector, <span class="math inline"><em>i⃗</em></span> is the left vector
and <span class="math inline"> − <em>i⃗</em></span> is the right
vector.</p>
<p>In elections we also don’t use the word “imaginary." The Senate Vote
exists, even if we put an <span class="math inline"><em>i⃗</em></span>
next to it. The proper term for the <span
class="math inline"><em>q⃗</em></span> vector is the “Forward Vector" and
the proper term for <span class="math inline"><em>i⃗</em></span> is the
“Lateral Vector."</p>
<p>We use the complex numbers for two races because the vote totals come
from the same population of voters in each precinct. Thus, we cannot add
them together as real numbers, but we can certainly treat them as
complex numbers. Here are eight numbers for Early and Mail-in totals for
Alice, Bob, Cathy and Dan.<br />
Let <span
class="math inline"><em>s⃗</em> = 214<em>q⃗</em> + 189<em>i⃗</em></span> be
Alice and Cathy’s Early Vote.<br />
Let <span
class="math inline"><em>t⃗</em> = 244<em>q⃗</em> + 251<em>i⃗</em></span> be
Bob and Dan’s Early Vote.<br />
Let <span
class="math inline"><em>u⃗</em> = 149<em>q⃗</em> + 158<em>i⃗</em></span> be
Alice and Cathy’s Mail-in Vote.<br />
Let <span
class="math inline"><em>v⃗</em> = 229<em>q⃗</em> + 209<em>i⃗</em></span> be
Bob and Dan’s Mail-in Vote.</p>
<p><span
class="math display">$$\vec{x_{1}}=\frac{\vec{s}}{\vec{s}+\vec{t}}=0.4491\vec{q}-0.0188\vec{i}$$</span>
<span
class="math display">$$\vec{y_{1}}=\frac{\vec{u}}{\vec{u}+\vec{v}}=0.4118\vec{q}+0.0181\vec{i}$$</span>
<span
class="math display">$$\vec{\alpha_{1}}=\frac{\vec{s}+\vec{u}}{\vec{s}+\vec{t}+\vec{u}+\vec{v}}=0.4321\vec{q}-0.0021\vec{i}$$</span>
<span
class="math display">$$\vec{\Omega_{1}}=\frac{\vec{s}+\vec{t}}{\vec{s}+\vec{t}+\vec{u}+\vec{v}}=0.5465\vec{q}-0.0013\vec{i}$$</span>
<span
class="math display">$$(1-\vec{\Omega_{1}})=\vec{\Omega_{2}}=\frac{\vec{u}+\vec{v}}{\vec{s}+\vec{t}+\vec{u}+\vec{v}}=0.4535\vec{q}+0.0013\vec{i}$$</span></p>
<p>All of the Twenty Laws and Forty Isometries hold for the Complex
Numbers, such as the Ninth Law (below). They also hold for the
quaternions and the biquaternions, however we have to be careful from
which side we multiply and divide from for the quaternions. For the
complex numbers we need not worry about which side we multiply from, so
we can apply them as written earlier in the chapter, such as:<br />
The Ninth Law: <span
class="math inline">$\vec{\alpha}=\vec{x}\vec{\Omega_{1}}+\vec{y}\vec{\Omega_{2}}$</span><br />
The Ninth Law: <span class="math inline">$\vec{\alpha}=\vec{x}\cos^{2}(
\vec\theta )+\vec{y}\sin^{2}( \vec\theta );
\cos(\vec{\theta})=+\sqrt{\Omega_{1}};
\sin(\vec{\theta})=+\sqrt{\Omega_{2}}$</span> <span
class="math display">$$1=\vec{\alpha_{1}}+\vec{\alpha_{2}}=\vec{\alpha_{1}}-\vec{i}^2\vec{\alpha_{2}}=\left(\vec{x_{1}}\cos^{2}(
\vec\theta )+\vec{y_{1}}\sin^{2}( \vec\theta
)\right)-\vec{i}^2\left(\vec{x_{2}}\cos^{2}( \vec\theta
)+\vec{y_{2}}\sin^{2}( \vec\theta )\right)$$</span></p>
<p>The Complex Numbers also carry over the analogs of Convergence,
Irrelevance and Twixt Lemmas, for instance the magnitude of <span
class="math inline">$\vec{\alpha_{1}}$</span> must be between the
magnitudes of <span class="math inline">$\vec{x_{1}}$</span> and <span
class="math inline">$\vec{y_{1}}$</span>, there is also a small rigid
set of binary (logical) laws govern the bounds of the angular argument
of <span class="math inline">$\vec{\alpha_{1}}$</span> based on the
angular arguments and magnitudes of <span
class="math inline">$\vec{\Omega_{1}}$</span>, <span
class="math inline">$\vec{x_{1}}$</span> and <span
class="math inline">$\vec{y_{1}}$</span>. Another example would be when
the real number magnitude of <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span>
goes to zero or one, making one of the modes (Election Day or Mail)
irrelevant, and making <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>
converge upon <span class="math inline">$\vec{x_{1}}$</span> or <span
class="math inline">$\vec{y_{1}}$</span> (whichever is the dominant
mode). You can visit this link to interact with Alice’s and Cathy’s
Complex Percentages: <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Bc64u1SeBrCL4Kp6DXz-c-1FsSRtQv97e5FZftvqWQ/edit?usp=sharing"
class="uri">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Bc64u1SeBrCL4Kp6DXz-c-1FsSRtQv97e5FZftvqWQ/edit?usp=sharing</a>.
In the top-left graph, we see the <span
class="math inline">$\vec{x_{1}}$</span> vector. Since the lateral
component is mostly negative, it means that the Republican, Cathy for
Senate, performed worse than Alice. Remember that since all of the
integers of the election are positive, it means negative lateral
components (and therefore negative angular arguments) will apportion
more votes to Alice and less to Cathy in respect to the Real Number
Magnitude of <span class="math inline">$\vec{x_{1}}$</span> (which you
can see as the horizontal axis of the graph titled “MagX vs MagY").</p>
<p>Likewise in the graph next to the top-left, we see the <span
class="math inline">$\vec{y_{1}}$</span> vector. Cathy mysteriously does
better than Alice in the Mail-in (since the lateral values are all
positive). We can see the real number magnitude of <span
class="math inline">$\vec{y_{1}}$</span> as the vertical axis of the
graph “MagX vs MagY." No matter how mysterious Cathy’s mail-in energy
may be, at least it’s a random scatter plot. We won’t be able to find a
complex number manifold that predicts <span
class="math inline">$\vec{\alpha_{1}}$</span> from <span
class="math inline">$\vec{x_{1}}$</span> and <span
class="math inline">$\vec{y_{1}}$</span> in this election.</p>
<p>To summarize a complex percentage: The Magnitude is the Strength of
the Republican Vote, and the Angle is the distribution of the magnitude.
As for the <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> percentage, in
both a fair election and an election that is “properly rigged" by a
HVNN, the lateral component of <span
class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> should be nigh zero, since we
expect the same proportion of Early to Mail-in votes across the races at
a precinct, and this expectation would be the Neural Network’s most
weighted cost function.</p>

<p>In the Washoe 2020 Election, Trump received 114,574 votes, and Biden
received 126,565 votes (thanks to the <span
class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span> Obstacle Percentage), a total of
241,138 ballots cast.</p>
<p>However, the Republican Amodei, for the Congressional House seat,
received 119,663 votes (4000 more than Trump), and the Democrat Ackerman
received 115,282 votes (11,000 less than Biden), a total of 234,954
ballots cast.</p>
<p>You are now going to see how this happened. It wasn’t because of
Trump’s popularity amongst Republicans, it was because of a Complex
Number Manifold that allows us to predict the Trump/Amodei complex
aggregate percentage from the complex <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> percentages, even the exact value
of the lateral part.</p>
<p>It’s amazing how Complex <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>
was perfectly calibrated in these precincts to achieve this! You can see
the below graphs identical in form to the graphs on the previous page in
the Alice/Cathy vs Bob/Dan election; however, the graphs show the
Complex West and East Side Percentages, instead of the Complex Early and
Mail-in Percentages. Likewise the graphs show Complex Lambda instead of
Complex Omega, since Lambda takes the place of Omega in the West vs East
Orientation.</p>

Introduction to Quaternionic Percentages and Manifolds for Four
Simultaneous Races</h2>
<p>For the quaternions we need define left and right handed
multiplication in a manner that upholds the Twenty Laws and Forty
Isometries. We can use the real/complex numbers as a guide. Let’s take a
look at the Ninth Law for the reals/complex numbers, where <span
class="math inline"><em>z⃗</em></span> is the total ballots cast:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>α⃗</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>x⃗</em><sub>1</sub><em>Ω⃗</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>y⃗</em><sub>1</sub><em>Ω⃗</em><sub>2</sub> = <em>s⃗</em>((<em>s⃗</em>+<em>t⃗</em>)<sup>−1</sup>)(<em>s⃗</em>+<em>t⃗</em>)(<em>z⃗</em>)<sup>−1</sup> + <em>u⃗</em>((<em>u⃗</em>+<em>v⃗</em>)<sup>−1</sup>)(<em>u⃗</em>+<em>v⃗</em>)(<em>z⃗</em>)<sup>−1</sup> = (<em>s⃗</em>+<em>u⃗</em>)(<em>z⃗</em>)<sup>−1</sup></span></p>
<p>Using the same ordering of left to right multiplication, the above
formula will hold for the quaternions.</p>
<p>Thus, we define the vector percentages as: <span
class="math display">$$\vec{x}_{1,b}=\vec{s}_{b}\left(\frac{1}{\vec{s}_{b}+\vec{t}_{b}}\right);
\vec{\Omega}_{1,b}=\left(\vec{s}_{b}+\vec{t}_{b}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\vec{z}_{b}}\right);
\vec{y}_{1,b}=\vec{u_{b}}\left(\frac{1}{\vec{u}_{b}+\vec{v}_{b}}\right);
\vec{\Omega}_{2,b}=\left(\vec{u_{b}}+\vec{v_{b}}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\vec{z}_{b}}\right)$$</span></p>
<p>Where <span
class="math inline"><em>s⃗</em><sub><em>b</em></sub> = <em>s</em><sub>1, <em>b</em></sub><em>q⃗</em> + <em>s</em><sub>2, <em>b</em></sub><em>i⃗</em> + <em>s</em><sub>3, <em>b</em></sub><em>j⃗</em> + <em>s</em><sub>4, <em>b</em></sub><em>k⃗</em></span>,

which are the Mail-in Totals for the four Republican Nominees in four
races at each <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span>

<p><span
class="math inline"><em>v⃗</em><sub><em>b</em></sub> = <em>v</em><sub>1, <em>b</em></sub><em>q⃗</em> + <em>v</em><sub>2, <em>b</em></sub><em>i⃗</em> + <em>v</em><sub>3, <em>b</em></sub><em>j⃗</em> + <em>v</em><sub>4, <em>b</em></sub><em>k⃗</em></span>,

at each <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span>
precinct.</p>
<p>Just as the angle of the complex number aggregate determines the
distribution of the alpha vector magnitude between both nominees of the
same party in two races, so do the angles of the quaternionic aggregate
determine the distribution of the alpha vector magnitude to the four
nominees of the same party in four races. We can rewrite the
quaternion,<span
class="math inline"><em>α⃗</em><sub>1, <em>b</em></sub></span> , as:
<span
class="math display"><em>α⃗</em><sub>1, <em>b</em></sub> = <em>a</em><sub>0, <em>b</em></sub><em>q⃗</em> + <em>a</em><sub>1, <em>b</em></sub><em>i⃗</em> + <em>a</em><sub>2, <em>b</em></sub><em>j⃗</em> + <em>a</em><sub>3, <em>b</em></sub><em>k⃗</em> = <em>a</em><sub>0, <em>b</em></sub><em>q⃗</em> + <em>w</em><sub><em>b</em></sub><em>Λ⃗</em><sub><em>b</em></sub> = <em>M</em><sub><em>b</em></sub>(<em>q⃗</em>cos(<em>θ</em><sub><em>b</em></sub>)+<em>Λ⃗</em><sub><em>b</em></sub>sin(<em>θ</em><sub><em>b</em></sub>))</span>
<span
class="math display">$$M_{b}=\sqrt{a_{0,b}^2+a_{1,b}^2+a_{2,b}^2+a_{3,b}^2};
\vec{\Lambda}_{b}=\frac{a_{1,b}\vec{i}+a_{2,b}\vec{j}+a_{3,b}\vec{j}}{\sqrt{a_{1,b}^2+a_{2,b}^2+a_{3,b}^2}};
\theta_{b}=ATAN2\left(\frac{\sqrt{a_{1,b}^2+a_{2,b}^2+a_{3,b}^2}}{a_{0,b}}\right
)$$</span> Where <span
class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub><em>b</em></sub></span> is the
magnitude of the alpha vector, <span
class="math inline"><em>Λ⃗</em><sub><em>b</em></sub></span> is the
direction of the vector in <span
class="math inline"><em>i</em>, <em>j</em>, <em>k</em></span> space and
<span class="math inline"><em>θ</em><sub><em>b</em></sub></span> is the
relationship between the first candidate and the other three candidates,
a perfect system to ensure that the Republican, Lombardo, wins the the
Gubernatorial Race (who stole the Republican primary from Gilbert),
while his three Republican nominees lose down the ballot.</p>
<p>However, since Mother Nature doesn’t have four-quadrant arctangent
function or a Magnitude Function (nor does she need them), the correct
way to write the alpha vector (in manner that holds for the
Biquaternions), is as follows (the angle, <span
class="math inline"><em>θ</em><sub><em>b</em></sub></span>, is a complex
number for the Biquaterions: <span
class="math display">$$\vec{\alpha}_{1,b}=a_{0,b}\vec{q}+w_{b}\vec{\Lambda}_{b}=a_{0,b}\sec{\theta_b}\left(\vec{q}\cos{\theta_b}+\vec{\Lambda}_b\sin{\theta_b}\right);
\theta_{b}=\arctan{\frac{w_{b}}{a_{0,b}}}$$</span> <span
class="math display">$$w_{b}=\sqrt{-\left({a_{1,b}\vec{i}}+{a_{2,b}\vec{j}}+{a_{3,b}\vec{k}}\right)\left({a_{1,b}\vec{i}}+{a_{2,b}\vec{j}}+{a_{3,b}\vec{k}}\right)}=\sqrt{a_{1,b}^2+a_{2,b}^2+a_{3,b}^2}$$</span></p>
<p>Notice that the only the regular Arctangent is used in the above
formulation. We can see this also holds for the complex numbers, which
are a subset of the biquaternions. For the below equation <span
class="math inline"><em>θ⃗</em></span> is a complex angle, describing an
affine basis of non-unit vectors, and <span
class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span> is a real number angle, describing
only a rotation of the existing affine basis, with the magnitude of
<span class="math inline"><em>z⃗</em></span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>Z</em></span>, scaling the entire rotated affine
basis at the end.</p>
<p>This form easily allows us to find the reciprocal and the <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span>
root of <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> unity for any
complex number, quaternion or biquaternion, and therefore allows us to
do Complex, Quaternionic and Biquaternionic Least Squares for two, four
or eight rigged races at a time. It also allows you to simply the
existing equations of Weyl Spinors and other quaterionic entities in the
physical sciences! <span
class="math display">$$\vec{a}\vec{q}+\vec{b}\vec{i}=\vec{a}\sec(\vec{\theta})\left(\vec{q}\cos{\vec{\theta}+\vec{i}\sin{\vec{\theta}}}\right)=\vec{z}\left(e^{\vec{\theta}}\right)=Z\left(e^{\vec{i}\phi}\right)\left(e^{\vec{\theta}}\right)=\left(e^{\vec{\theta}+\vec{i}\left(\phi-\vec{i}\ln{Z}\right)}\right);
\vec{\theta}=\arctan\left(\frac{\vec{b}}{\vec{a}}\right)$$</span> <span
class="math display">$$\vec{z}=\vec{a}\sec(\vec{\theta})=z_{0}\vec{q}+z_{1}\vec{i}=z_{0}\sec(\phi)\left(\vec{q}cos{\phi}+\vec{i}\sin(\phi)\right);

Z=\sqrt{\left(z_{0}\vec{q}+z_{1}\vec{i}\right)\left(z_{0}\vec{q}-z_{1}\vec{i}\right)}$$</span>
Hence we can write any biquaterion, using <span
class="math inline"><em>w⃗</em></span> as the immediate lateral vector to
<span class="math inline"><em>q⃗</em></span> that commutes with <span

Thus the reciprocal of a biquaternion is given as: <span
class="math display">$$\left(\vec{a}\vec{q}+\vec{b}\vec{\Lambda}\right)^{-1}=\left(\sqrt[-2]{\left(z_0\vec{q}+z_{1}\vec{w}\right)\left(z_0\vec{q}-z_{1}\vec{w}\right)}\right)\left(\vec{q}\cos(-\phi)+\vec{w}\sin(-\phi)\right)\left(\vec{q}cos{(-\vec{\theta})}+\vec{\Lambda}\sin{(-\vec{\theta})}\right)$$</span>
And the Mth Root of N unity, <span
class="math inline">$\sqrt[m,n]{\left(\vec{a}\vec{q}+\vec{b}\vec{\Lambda}\right)}$</span>,
is given by: <span
class="math display">$$\left(\sqrt[-2n]{\left(z_0\vec{q}+z_{1}\vec{w}\right)\left(z_0\vec{q}-z_{1}\vec{w}\right)}\right)
\left(\vec{q}\cos\left(\frac{\phi+2m\pi}{n}\right)+\vec{w}\sin\left(\frac{\phi+2m\pi}{n}\right)\right)
\left(\vec{q}cos{\left(\frac{1}{n}\vec{\theta}\right)}+\vec{\Lambda}\sin{\left(\frac{1}{n}\vec{\theta}\right)}\right)$$</span></p>
<p>It pains me to say that I have pioneered the depths of Hypercomplex
Numbers to save my country from Election Fraud, rather than to advance
the knowledge and potential of mankind through the sciences and
generalized data analysis (such as hypercomplex market analysis). Alas,
it is so, and it had to be done to save us all from Hypercomplex-Valued
Neural Networks rigging our elections.</p>
<p>For now we shall stick with the regular quaternions for Nevada, since
Biquaternions aren’t needed here (they rig eight elections at a time
with Biquaternions in Will County Illinois).</p>

<p>Now let’s discuss the three key features of this formula, the three
features that they thought would protect them from being discovered.
<span
class="math display"><em>α⃗</em><sub><em>b</em></sub> = <em>c⃗</em><sub>0</sub> + <em>g⃗</em><sub><em>b</em></sub><em>c⃗</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>h⃗</em><sub><em>b</em></sub><em>c⃗</em><sub>2</sub> + <em>g⃗</em><sub><em>b</em></sub><em>c⃗</em><sub>3</sub><em>g⃗</em><sub><em>b</em></sub> + <em>g⃗</em><sub><em>b</em></sub><em>c⃗</em><sub>4</sub><em>h⃗</em><sub><em>b</em></sub> + <em>h⃗</em><sub><em>b</em></sub><em>c⃗</em><sub>5</sub><em>g⃗</em><sub><em>b</em></sub> + <em>h⃗</em><sub><em>b</em></sub><em>c⃗</em><sub>6</sub><em>h⃗</em><sub><em>b</em></sub></span></p>
<p>The first feature is the most obvious: They used the West vs East
Paradigm. They know that no one would ever think to consider the West
and East percentages. Remember that I only discovered them by accident
by placing Biden’s Mail-in Vote in his Election Day column (and vice
versa).</p>
<p>The second feature is that it’s Quaternion of four races. In the
event that someone discovered the West and East Side Percentages, they
would still have to realize that they were dealing with a quaternionic
of four races.</p>
<p>I was able to intuit that quaternions were involved when I found the
manifold of Atlanta, Georgia, 2020 of Trump vs Biden, because the <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>α</em></span> real
number manifold could not be solved directly from the <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>α</em></span> precinct
coordinates, but rather had to first be rotated (I used Euler Angles at
the time) before a regression of the rotated coordinates could
faithfully return the original all three of the original <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>, <em>h</em>, <em>α</em></span> values
with a high <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sup>2</sup></span>
exceeding 0.99.</p>
<p>However, I did not know where the other quaternionic values came from
in Atlanta (it never occurred to me at that time that they came from
other races, as I was only analyzing the Trump vs Biden race in
Atlanta)—so I kept it in mind.</p>
<p>When I discovered the Complex Number Manifold of two races for Trump
vs Amodei in 2020 (Washoe), was when I connected the dots, and realized
they were using quaternions to rig four races at a time. Which leads us
to the third feature.</p>
<p>The third feature is that the third, fourth, fifth and sixth
quadratic constants are sandwiched between the <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> vectors. They did this because one
cannot simply perform ordinary least squares (that is multiply the
Design Matrix by the conjugate transpose).</p>
<p>In fact it was once thought impossible to to derive a “Middle-Handed"
constant via Least Squares. The paper titled <em>An Iterative Algorithm
for Least Squares Problem in Quaternionic Quantum Theory</em>, from the
<em>Computer Physics Communications, Volume 179, Issue 4, Pages
203-207</em>, was the best solution (and still a terrible one) at the
time to handle the issue, which tried to converge upon (using a neural
network) a local minimum solution magnitude error (via a residual cost
function). Thus, it wasn’t surprising to see that simply plugging in
left or right handed constants against the quadratic terms failed to
produce an faithful regression of the rigged elections, because they
were rigged with Middle-Handed Constants.</p>
<p>Not even the conniving ghouls that programmed the Middle-Handed
Constants into the software knew how to back-solve their own rig via
Quaternionic Least Squares.</p>
<p>Thus, even if someone discovered both the West vs East Paradigm, and
suspected a quaternionic setup of four races—they thought no one could
ever get past their final obfuscation—the Middle-Handed Constants.</p>
<p>But I got them. And they’re going to prison. Not even the best
attorneys and “experts" can defend a West vs East Quaternionic Manifold
with Middle-Handed Constants that governs the vote proportions between
the precincts of two counties on opposite sides of the State of Nevada—
and of Atlanta, of Michigan, of Pennsylvania, of Texas (Tarrant County),
of Illinois, of Virginia, of Arizona, of Ohio, of Arkansas, of
Tennessee...of EVERY STATE IN THE UNION ON AND AFTER November 3rd of
2020.</p>
<p>I am proud to say that I have saved my country from Quaternionic
Election Fraud, for now Article 4, Section 4, of the United States
Constitution must now be enforced:</p>
<p><em>The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a
<strong>Republican Form of Government</strong>, and shall protect each
of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of
the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic
Violence.</em></p>
<p>Without fair elections, we no longer have a Republican Form of
Government. God Bless America.</p>
